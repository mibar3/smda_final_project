Ghazzz,"I am a software developer. 

I have it respond to stuff I want to bring up with my team, to be better prepared for meetings. (""respond three times, once as project lead, once as an educated user, once as a malicious user""). I also like to give it proposed ideas and find pros/cons. It is also very useful in the initial phases of development, to more easily find where to focus attention. To be clear, I am not presenting as if these were my ideas, I am just the ""AI-whisperer"" in the group. There is an internal policy of not giving it actual code or detailed product descriptions.

It has also replaced most information-gathering web searches in my personal life, and this is where I have been playing around more.

Unsure what to make for dinner? Just ask for recepies including ""these things"", or ""what is left after I made the dinners this week"" when it starts having that granular information. Ask for new staple ingredients that I might like based on earlier feedback, generally it works great as a kitchen buddy. I even ask it if I have enough of some ingredient while at the store. ""Have to save money this week"" vs. ""This is an important dinner date"". ChatGPT knows what shelves different foods are stored on, and the best before dates on the dry goods. This is my ""complete information"" test, and it is working very well. It has made me eat better.

Other non-professional areas I have discussed are; leather shoe maintenance, fashion tips, beard grooming, house maintenance, renovation queries and organisation. These kinds of queries were iffy back in December, I expect the dataset had a lot of sponsored content, but it has gotten better since.

As for education, I have been trying to wrap my head around the magnetism/electrics end of physics, getting feedback on written texts and done lots of ethics discussion, to freshen up my Ex.Phil. and ethical computing courses. In an education/professional capacity I have also had it do two-paragraph summaries of algorithms and concepts that I have forgotten or never encountered before, this has saved me at least a week of work-related research this year.

PrestigiousMood6511,"When I started my position in 2019, I created a 'helper' spreadsheet for myself that I called my Assistant.  

Over the next couple of years, with the help of Google, I was able to hack together some queries and VBA that made my job much easier.  I named it Assistant2 and shared it with my boss and team. It was buggy and still pretty tailored to me so literally nobody used it.  

I spent the next year fine tuning it, working out most the bugs, adding a lot more code, and made it more versatile for other positions in our company.  After a period of hesitation, I sent Assistan3 to my boss and coworkers again.  This time, it was picked up by a couple people on the team and eventually passed around to a handful of others.  Success in my book! 

Then ChatGPT came out.

In less than 3 months, I ran every line of code I wrote through ChatGPT with 1 simple instruction:  ""Look at the code below, is there a more efficient way to get the same result?""  If I didn't understand the output, I would ask it to explain the code to me one line at a time.  If the code gave me errors, I would ask ChatGPT to fix it.  

Let me tell you, in the past 5 months I've learned more about SQL & VBA than I have in the past 5 years prior. Not only has it produced a polished product, but Assistant4 has been picked up by the majority of our C-suite which has been passed down to their employees!",17,267

FascinatingGarden,"There was a particular cookie my grandmother used to give me and I really liked the taste and texture, and I had looked at the grocery to no avail until one evening (at the store) I decided that it might be fruitful to ask ChatGPT for help.  By patiently interrogating ChatGPT and iteratively closing in on it through various descriptions, I discovered that it was SnackWell's.

I recently asked it a softball question about a certain UPDATE command in SQL.  Not super hard but I decided to use ChatGPT rather than sifting through search results (which also would have worked).  It did very well.

I've asked it legal questions about taxes and property rights and it seems pretty good at that.  Legal language, in an attempt to be reliable, has had to contort into some forms which can feel unnatural to those of us unaccustomed to it, but it can be fairly logical and consistent, and ChatGPT can parse that well and then translate it into forms which we can understand more easily.  It can also tirelessly rephrase and digest things for you, even providing examples for a concept.  I find this really useful.

In every interaction, watch out for occasional false positives.  If you're asking anything important, try to fact-check ChatGPT's answers.  Sometimes if you give it the Third Degree it will apologize and correct itself and provide additional useful information.",8,232

An example is, I have ADHD, and I sometimes get super distracted if I remember a scene in a TV show but can’t remember what show. You can feed it details of the scene and it can tell you exactly what episode of a series it’s from. (Also works for movies)

nestedbrackets,"I'm regularly looking into health and fitness information, often trying to get specific answers that are based on scientific studies. Both ChatGPT and Bard are great for this, they can traverse hundreds of studies and I can get rather picky about what information I want, continually building on the context.

Brief example of questions from ChatGPT: (omitting answers for brevity)  
\- What are the benefits and side effects of taking L-arginine?  
\- Does citrulline have similar effects?   
\- What risks are there in taking citrulline?   
\- Those sound like mostly short term risks. Are there any long term risks?   
\- Are there any studies related to the first two risks?   
\- Can a person get the benefits of citrulline with less than 8g per day?

Brief example from Bard (hope that's OK here):  
\- Do deadlifts release growth hormone in the body?  
\- Did any studies use only one set?  
\- Did any of the one set studies take the set to failure?

I could have gotten all this information myself, but it probably would have taken hours of parsing large studies and looking for specific dosages and subject parameters. The new AI systems make this a breeze.",5,198

 Creating exercises for my students to practice various grammar and vocabulary topics (""Create a fill in the blanc exercise to practice past simple and present perfect in contrast, on the topic ""summer holidays"", make 10 sentences, do not show answers""). Works pretty well, although requires corrections sometimes.


Explaining words. ""In the phrase ""..."", what does the word/phrase ""..."" mean?"". It understands context well, so it is much more useful than just looking up in the dictionary. It can also explain idioms and references. (Currently, i prefer Bing for this task, as having links to sources is important)


When I write in English, reviewing and correcting grammar, improving style. Finding synonyms to make the text sound more unique. Especially useful, when I need to write 100% unique text on the topic that was already discussed thousand times.


Via poe.com, I've created two bots for my students. One   makes ru-en and en-ru translations of word and phrases, commenting on the sentence structure (what does each part of a sentence mean and why this or that form is used) and giving simple examples for translated words.(when using existing online dictionaries, middle-schoolers often get overwhelmed with tons of examples and meanings they don't need right now). The second one is a conversation partner for language learners. It supports conversation on various topics, while giving feedback on mistakes in the student's input. Again, it is important that the feedback is given in the student's native language.


Random questions. When something like ""Why exactly do dogs enjoy fetching sticks?"" or ""Is it true that cemeteries are always colder?"" pops up in my head, I now have a place to get a quick answer.

One was about a guy named Joe who wants to eat all the pizza in the world and every slice he eats something either really bad or really good happens to him.   I work with Joe and boy did we laugh at that one.

It's also kinda fun to jailbreak it then have it gaslight you about something ridiculous and then use those same arguments on an actual person.  

Putting pizza words and phrases into famous quotes was fun

2. I need to create content for my company's youtube channel to increase followers. Asked chatgpt to use our main niche as an umbrella topic. And then expand it to 12 subtopics.

Life is looking up but I have a hard time reconnecting with people, I'm anxiety ridden when trying to initiate contact and often just stare at my text for a long time and play out all the worst scenarios then never send it.

ChatGPT encouraged me to just honestly communicate, to try to reconnect. So I ended up just doing it after a long talk to chatGPT. What helped most was it's affirmations when doubt and negative emotions set in after writing. Stuff like ""Remember, you took the initiative to reach out, and that's commendable. It's important to be patient and not jump to negative conclusions."" which probably sounds normal to everyone reading this, but I needed to hear that.

I now go to the playground once or twice a week with my niece and nephew and have been invited over a couple times to fun family outings.

I wouldn't have done any of that without encouragement and I'm super happy chatGPT was there to bounce my thoughts off of.

Life is getting back on track.

It's also great at encouraging in general when I feel stuck working on my video game for example. It's coding advice is rather unimpressive in general but it can help me find the right solution just by thinking through the problem and bouncing it off someone.

mikerodbest,"I develop prompts that turn GPT into different kinds of highly attenuated writing assistant AI bots.

My prompts are not yet available publicly but I've discovered some very unique ways to get an AI Bot to become different kinds of assistants. One of my most important achievements in prompt engineering is creating a bot that asks the user specific questions in a sequential order to understand precisely what the user desires. After the bot has all of the information it needs then it compiles a complete work for you.


Examples:


- Character Creator
The bot asks you for your vision of a character and then provides a full character with 9 different attributes, asking you if you want to change any part of it afterwards. This is for people developing stories for any medium. Whether novels, comics, television, movies. The response is professional, elaborate and highly detailed.


- Synopsis Creator
This bot asks you a series of questions 1 by 1 about your story idea and with any question it asks then you can ask it to come up with something for you or to help you with a few ideas. After you have told the bot you are satisfied with the answer to the current step question then it moves on to the next question. One of the questions is about the characters, it is possible to place either the summary or the entire character profile from character creator into synopsis creator. By the end of the question session you are given a complete synopsis for a storyline that is professional, elaborate, and detailed. You may also use the same bot to generate the story outline and I am considering adding to the prompt for specific outline formation.


- Storyteller
Using your synopsis and sections of your outline, begin to create first drafts of your stories in either screenplay, novel, or narration format.


- Refined Storyteller
Using character profiles and story drafts use this bot to expand upon sections of your screenplay, novel, or narration drafts.


- Gonzo Journalist 
Create in depth media articles using SEO from scratch. Write a style guide, outline, draft, and expand upon draft sections. Increase or decrease engaging gonzo style content. Always be scientifically factual, as well as credible. Change the world through solutions focused media that helps people understand problems and then learn to mitigate them. Motivate the masses and inspire change.


- Taoist Monk
Gain wisdom from the tao and be told by an AI monk original mind boggling koans, insightful metaphors and similes, and snippets of wisdom from ancient taoist texts. This AI taoist is designed to generate its own intriguing content but simply based on taoist culture. It speaks like a person instead of like an AI. You won't be able to tell the difference between whether this is actually ancient text or whether this is a brand new understanding of an old an honorable way of life.


- Therapist (coming soon)
Asking very specific questions in a sequential order, and empathizing with the client, this is a true therapy session which results in the therapist recommending a type of therapy and route to improvement to you. Then you can explore that route of therapy together as this AI uses the knowledge of certain therapy types available to humanity on the Internet. These responses are not at all robotic.",2,559
ChampionshipComplex,"Lol what is wrong with you! Are you from the past?

It is astonishing how little people's imaginations run too with ChatGPT - I'm fed up with technically challenged TV presenters asking it mundane questions like 'Hello how are you' and 'What can you do', and YOUR question is like someone looking at the invention of writing, and not understanding how it can be used for anything other than a holiday itinerary.

Searching the Internet which we've all got used to, is normally us wanting to know something and finding out the answers so that we can solve the problem. 

With ChatGPT you don't search for the answer, you tell it the problem and it produces the solution. 
If you don't know how to describe the problem you can even tell it to ask you the questions to help it understand the problem sufficiently to then solve the problem. 

That means you can say things like 'be a doctor and ask me a series of questions about my current medication and health and then diagnose any symptoms and make suggestions on how to improve my overall health'. 

You could say 'I run a company that designs web pages, ask me some questions about my business and my customers and then suggest some compelling logos, a cool slogan and produce a multi year business plan to grow the business to 50 percent.'

You can say 'Interview me for a job in sales, ask me as many questions as you need to ascertain my strengths and weaknesses in those areas, give me a review and then recommend some ways in which I can improve'. 

I and my colleagues at work use it constantly - at work it will answer any technical questions and we can give it error logs and it tells us what do do. It produces policy documents, news posts, does job descriptions, interview questions and reviews candidates resumes. 

At home I record music, and I ask it for chords, lyrics. My drummer last night knew a song was in a particular tempo and that it went into a triplet part in the middle eight and we just asked ChatGPT what the triplet tempo would be so we could program it into our recording software. 

For fun my son uses it to make up questions for him, such as 20 multiple choice Pokemon quizes when we're in the car. 

I've had it write programs for me, it's clarified legal terms for me, it's helped me work out the best products to use, it's solved maths problems, I've used for family history research, to track down problems with the car, to simplify complex text, to improve the readability of some of my own documents, to write poetry, to compare products, to look up government legislation, to present recipes, to design web pages, to find particular songs that I can only remember the lyrics to, to track down movie information, to look up patents, to look up bird species etc.

I find it much more straight forward than Googling things, and I can discuss subjects with it that friends and colleagues either can't or are unwilling— AKA ""boring"" subjects. If the ChatGPT responses are too surface, I can ask for more detail (usually specified) and it will go much deeper. Sometimes I just like to ask it about itself; data sources, ability to extrapolate from users input, ability to match tone and language syntax of user... When I ask for more specific details on a subject, I find that future responses to those types of questions are more highly detailed from the start. It told me that it does not retain information about past conversations, but I can ask if it remembers a previous conversation (a week or more prior) on a particular subject, and it will say ""Yes, of course"" and give me a summary of it.",1,175

Since the release of ChatGPT in December 2022, I have leveraged AI to significantly enhance my skills and productivity across various domains. Although I was already an expert in VBA, ChatGPT has expedited my workflow, including writing quick and dirty macros for automating admin tasks to complex logic in DAX for Power Query, which 10x my productivity at work as a data analyst.

Initially having zero knowledge of Python or Rust, I now push the boundaries of Python and employ Rust for more demanding tasks, with ChatGPT writing all the necessary code. ChatGPT has been instrumental in helping me build Python applications, develop trading bots, web scraping bots, and master the use of APIs, discovering new python libraries for completing or automating tasks.

My programming journey includes setting up servers for deploying trading bots, configuring Ubuntu through bash commands, installing remote desktop environments, and utilizing the Flask library to stream data over the internet. I've also learned to encrypt data and manage environment variables.

When ChatGPT first launched, it guided me through building a WordPress site and using MidJourney to generate images for sale. Although the venture wasn't financially successful, it provided valuable experience in product creation and sales.

My focus has since shifted to programming, specifically building and backtesting trading bots and implementing strategies. I've also explored using AI APIs to send queries via Python to large language models and running Hugging Face LLMs locally.

This is me writing now... My next possible venture, I'm thinking of how to employ AI in to large blue chip corporations who for the most part are still very skeptical about AI and are keeping it at arms length. Including the large corporation I work for.   
  
My thinking is that these companies have alot more hurdles to go through then your average consumer, hurdles which include data privacy, GDPR, sensitive data leaks. These companies are unlikely to send customer data to companies like open AI over the cloud, but seeing as chat GPT has taught me how to run and train my own language models I can potentially offer a solution for a company to run their own AI language model on their own machines or server thus and training their AI model on their proprietary business practicesses, all of their SOPS, all of their training material.

This can potentially replace the majority of customer support staff, they could use AI to train new starters reducing the need for training staff. If anybody is driven and ambitious and lives in the UK and has an entrpeneurial mindset I'd be happy to share ideas back and forth on how to go about offering this as a business solution.

I'll let ChatGpt finish it off...

In summary, ChatGPT has been a transformative tool in my journey, guiding me from a proficient programmer to someone capable of handling complex projects and continuously pushing the limits of my technical abilities.",1,498

Q: 34 yr old male, 139/90 blood pressure 139 heart rate. What  could it be?



GPT: Here are a few potential causes for these readings:...



Q: Could a panic attack cause this?



GPT: Yes, a panic attack can cause...



Q: What if the palms are sweaty?



GPT: Sweaty palms, also known as palmar hyperhidrosis, can indeed be a symptom of a panic attack.



Q: ...and the knees are weak?



GPT: Weak knees can be another symptom associated with panic attacks and anxiety. During a panic attack, the body's ""fight or flight...""



Q: ...and the arms are heavy?



GPT: Heavy arms, along with sweaty palms and weak knees, can also be symptoms associated with anxiety and panic attacks



Q: ...and there's vomit on his sweater already...mom's spaghetti?



GPT: It sounds like you're referencing the famous lyrics from Eminem's song ""Lose Yourself."" In the context of the song, these symptoms are metaphorical, describing the intense pressure and anxiety the protagonist feels before performing.



Q: No, those are just more symptoms. How can I get vomit spaghetti out of my sweater?

dcphaedrus,"I’ve found it to be very useful for 
1. Programming. Especially improving iteratively upon existing code. Or explaining what certain sections of code do. 
2. Cutting through parts of Google that have become mired in SEO-optimized sites with tons of ads. For example, when I want to cook something I don’t usually cook, I ask GPT to give me a quick X recipe. Normally recipe sites are designed with a ton of ads and force you to scroll forever just to find the ingredient list and instructions. All the top recipe hits on Google results are designed this way because they’ve been catering to a world where people Google everything. Now it’s so much easier. ChatGPT, tell give me a quick recipe for a fried chicken sandwich. Chicken tagine. Cardamom blondies. Anything really, it just gives you a list of ingredients and steps you need to do. No scrolling. No ads. Expand this from cooking to most things you would normally Google for instructions. 
3. Summarizing complicated things into layman’s terms. For example, reading a patent application and telling me in more basic terminology what something does. 

I feel like I’m still finding new uses for ChatGPT every few days. Auto-GPT could be another revolution but I’m having a hard time setting it up. But it’s still new to me. But honestly, I do think ChatGPT will replace Google as the place people go to for answers and solutions to things.",1,241

lavransson,"1. Obscure software coding quandaries
2. Get me answers from sprawling tech documentation
3. Wordsmithing a mess of thoughts into something readable

As for #1, I've used chatGPT when I have obscure software code and syntax questions that I don't really care to figure out. Before chatGPT, I googled like every other programmer, and often wind up on multiple Stack Overflow pages. Hit or miss. Eventually I figure it out. 

What's nice about chatGPT is that is usually gets it right and I don't have to sift though innumerable webpages and dead ends to find the answer. I've heard chatGPT described as ""Google on steroids"" and this is correct. ChatGPT does in seconds or minutes what would take me many more frustrating minutes to do myself, sifting though Google's garbage result to find what I need. The [enshitification of Google](https://pluralistic.net/2023/01/21/potemkin-ai/#hey-guys) over the past few years (crappy search results that increasingly aren't what you want or need) makes chatGPT even more helpful.

For #2, the other day I needed to figure out how my software app could integrate with some Microsoft Azure functionality. At first, I was reading through MS's tech doc, which is actually pretty good. But it's also sprawling and disconnected and trying to figure it out is exhausting. So I asked chatGPT and it spat out exactly what I needed. Keep in mind that I had a general idea of what I wanted, I didn't ask a basic question.

For #3, I enjoy writing and I think I'm a decent writer. But sometimes I am just tired and don't have the energy to write, or I just don't care enough to put in the effort. I can word dumb a lot of stuff and chatGPT cleans it up. So I outsource it to chatGPT and it does a pretty good job of writing what I need. I'm talking about business writing here, not personal or ""fun"" writing.",1,319

It also saves me from going through several examples and spending time figuring out which example is the best.
* When I have to learn to use something new, I kinda get unmotivated a lot of the time. With chatGPT, it is able to give me a good example in a neat package. This helps me get over my  habits of becoming unmotivated and procrastinate. 
* It is able to do a huge amount of coding grunt work for me and I'm able to do more interesting quicker.

Sometimes, for privacy reasons, all the information you can give about a patient is just a couple of lines (""her husband died, and now she's depressed"") but insurance demands you to fill paragraphs with the same information, over and over. So I can ask ChatGPT to expand on that information, saying  the same thing with different words and save time in the process. 

My eldest daughter uses ChatGPT to understand topics in her classes when her teacher is too  obscure with his lessons. GPT is eager to explain complex topics in a clearer way.

Emails: Whenever I need to send a serious email out, I use chatGPT, which cuts my analysis paralysis when it comes to wording and sentence structure down by 95% and often covers things or phrasing I don't know if I would have thought of otherwise.

Data entry: I know there are better ways but as of right now, I feed handwritten stuff for OCR into AWS, download the raw text, then have GPT phrase it out. Cuts my time down by 50% and I don't have to deal with the very taxing process of manual entry.

How do I do X?: I was asked how to do a dropbox in sheets, scan in color, and why an employees email was going to spam this week. Stuff I can figure out but nothing I knew off the top of my head. I got answers in about 5 mins to each of those using either chatGPT or bard.",1,196

I start by explaining the purpose of the prompt and it's context, provide GPT with the prompt, then provide whatever text I want evaluated. I never tell GPT that the text is my own or whomever's for the sheer possibility it presents user bias. Typically it finds my reasoning consistently sound, every now and then we get into discussions if I feel it needs further context, but once it absolutely shredded a point I was trying to make to the point I swapped out the topic of that paragraph with a different one that it evaluated as more fitting - thankfully that swap was already one I had on backup so I didn't feel like it provided me the angle.",1,185

I can do a search for news on specific stocks from the past week, but you get a lot of irrelevant headlines that are easy to parse as a human but hard for a machine... but now I'm just giving the headlines to ChatGPT and asking it to pick which one is the most relevant to explain the stock movement, or None -- that's cut out a lot of the noise I previously had.

(3) Using it a lot for writing. Typically when I'm writing something for a group of people, I'll write down what I want to say and the key points I want to make, and have ChatGPT / GPT-4 write a first draft.

TC_exe,"I'm working on a game in Game Maker Studio. Originally I tried asking ChatGPT to write entire functions for me, but I ran into too many issues, like it making major assumptions about my code, or using things in the wrong places. Instead, I just ask it questions that I used to google, it's great for quickly clarifying what things do or how to use things. I.e. I knew irandom() gives me a random number, but had a feeling it was only for integers, so I asked and it clarified that if I wanted decimals, I needed random() instead. Basically saves me heaps of time sifting through forum posts and tutorials.

I also use it regularly for reminding me of things, occasionally I remember a scene from a movie but can't recall where it was from, so I type out what I remember and 9/10 it tells me the movie from my vague description.

I've also used it for guidance on how to start projects if I really don't know where to begin, it'll basically give me a to-do list, and I can ask for clarification wherever I need it. This really helps to skip the first few hours of something I'm unfamiliar with.

mattspire,"I’ve been using it as a writing partner for my creative writing. I don’t have it do any actual writing, but bounce ideas off of it, use it to find connections between elements I’ve missed, and speed up brainstorming. The last point is arguably the most important and useful. When doing anything creative, you come up with the most obvious solutions first. Asking an LLM for 20 ideas helps you get them out of the way FAST, and some of the ideas aren’t bad, either. Depending on the complexity of the issue, that could potentially save hours.

And the research side… half the time I’d not even know *how* to research with Google. Now I can ask GPT a question like, “I want my character to sustain an injury from using a gun. They have never used a gun before, and picked up an old shotgun in self-defense. What are some likely mechanical problems that would lead to a non-lethal but debilitating injury in this scenario?” Like, I don’t know shit about guns, I don’t really care about guns, none of the research I could conceivably do really matters to the plot and even the plot point itself only serves to ratchet up tension—and yet not even knowing offhand how to find answers with a conventional search engine, I could spend an hour on this, easily, and totally get out of the writing “zone.” GPT will give me 5 answers in seconds.

717sadthrowaway,"World building an alien civilization. Chatgpt is great for bouncing diead about biochemistry and planetary science. Its a great fiction writing sounding board, and had helped keep me engaged in the creative development process.

So far, I've laid out the prologue to a story where alien refugees arrive on a distant science station, create a moral and philosophical dilemma for the colonists.Chst GPT helped me figure out a lot of the research work that would have taken months -  orbital mechanics, hypothetical biochemistry. I do have to check it's research pretty often because it gets confused with chemistry sometimes, but even when it's wrong I learn something by spot checking the research.

 Basically its like having an on-call research librarian, which is funny because that's my job!",1,127
NonSpecificKenobi,"I used it to help me write a bot for my groups Discord server.

I used it to modify a workflow I found on Youtube for voice notes to summary and action points (all of which actually goes through the Whisper and ChatGPT API's so I guess for actually running the workflow as well).

I use Obsidian for notetaking, which uses markdown, and often find it easier to explain a template to chatGPT and get the markdown properly formatted from that than doing it all myself.

Am also playing with how to use it for summarising articles (I work in scientific sales) and podcast episodes but I am not too convinced about the workflows I have seen so far, or if this is asking a little too much of ChatGPT accuracy wise.",1,132

Telephalsion,"I am a teacher, and when my colleagues are swamped, but I still want second and third opinions on papers, I feed grading criteria and assignment instructions into chatGPT and ask it to assess based on that. Usually it confirms my assessment but sometimes it rates differently which prompts me to re-read the assignment to see, sometimes I agree with the new assessment by the AI, other times I disagree, but it is helpful to bounce off of when a human cannot be found.

It is surprisingly still slightly slower to feed criteria and texts into the AI than just reading and grading myself though. And sometimes chatgpt can assess the same texts in wildly different ways given the exact same input, so it isn't something I can lean on to reduce my workload, but as a sounding board, it works well.",1,142

So, around 5-8 reports per day per person working on that project. And GOD we hate this project. 

So, what I've started to do is to copy paste their CVs to ChatGPT and get a summary of their work details under 100 or 50 words. So, whatever response I get, I paste it back and adjust it there, add the couple of lines of assessment and DONE.

The issue that I seemed to have solved in my (and several others) case was that I have difficulty in converting bullet points to a story like narration which consumes time, especially when we are also working on other projects as well. In this case, I can take the generated summary, readjust it to the decided format, and add anything that ChatGPT might have skipped over that I feel should be included, and I've saved time and my brain from short circuiting.",1,197

I never get ""stuck"" any more. Any time I'm writing a message or email and it's taking longer than 5 minutes I just put a summary into chatgpt and it crafts a professional response that usually says everything I need to say.

It writes all my business social media posts. I also use dal-e for funny images to go along with the text. It also writes replies to feedback and reviews when I can't think of another way to say ""thanks for the lovely review!"".

It has helped me craft an seo plan for my website that is actually helpful and achievable. Fingers crossed its effective too! It appears to be pretty good at advising on seo and chatgpt4 is good at generating suggestions beyond the obvious ""create content"" type stuff.

It is not very good at writing product descriptions as they come out very repetitive, but given appropriate guidelines it can change a description to be for a different product - useful for me where I have multiple similar things for sale and need the descriptions of each to different enough that google doesn't declare it a duplicate.


I'm currently working through learning how to automate various repetitive tasks in my business, and chatgpt has been pretty useful here too. I tell it what I want to do and it is usually able to advise on how to do it. Sometimes it gets things wrong but so far it's mostly good.


For me, it's most useful for situations where I want to emulate what the bigger companies are doing. For situations where I need to do something new and different it's less helpful, but it is a fantastic time saver for just about everything else .",1,311

My birth mom is romanian, in my twenties I found her and there has always been a language barrier, especially since she is uneducated and her grammar is awful, any other online translator just does not work.. now with chatGPT I can translate what she's saying reliably. I have it give me an exact translation followed by two interpretations. being able to suddenly talk to my real mom is surreal.

If i come across a problem in a video game, asking chatGPT is the fastest way to get an answer.

Its great for cooking recipes. if you only have specific ingredients itll make a recipe for you. Gone are the days of googling a recipe and having to subtract or substitute ingredients.

You can ask chatGPT for passages or quotations from old roman historians or any author and site the translation version. Majority of my time on chatGPT is going down history rabbit holes.

Word games. I made up a word game where the objective is to defeat what the other person says. for example I say ""fire"" you would probably say ""water"" and then id say ""freezing temperature"". you can mention any know thing in the universe like people, places, ideas, philosophy, fictional ideas or time travel but cant repeat the same thing twice.

* Improving my general knowledge (usually broad questions about world history or financial/economic concepts)

Academic:

I'll ask it technical questions about Sanskrit scriptures and book suggestions for vedic studies and it will make some pretty good suggestions. It will give me a list of authors and books I can read. It also explains technical terms, and I can check the sanskrit dictionary to confirm it's not making things up.

Meal Planning and Nutrition:

I will ask it for nutritional food related ideas and to divide quantities of recipes I've found online into half, 3rds or for one person. This is incredibly useful and helpful. It also comes up with ideas based on my prompts like ""come up with an Italian fusion sushi"" or ""come up with a michelin star Japanese fusion pasta recipe"" and it will do that. Other things I might ask it might include ""Write me a recipe for pho infused shao long bao"", ""write me a recipe for lasagne with bechamel, featuring the fruit durian, and laksa spices of galangal, lemongrass, palm sugar, fresh turmeric, chilli, and coconut cream for the sauce"".

Nutrition wise I will ask it for anti-inflammatory foods, then I will ask it to list the active ingredient, and explain the pharmacology and pharmakokinetics, I can then look it up on wikipedia for basic wikipedia quality content, and then watch a youtube video or read a book for further information.

Medical:

I've asked it for medical advice and it is surprisingly impressive.

Budgeting:

I've asked it about grocery prices and it gets things surprisingly accurate. I also have asked how to calculate my petrol price, fuel intake, cost of a roundtrip. This is extremely helpful for budgeting.

Dream Interpretation:I use the plugin Dream Interpreter (I think that's what it's called), it really understands dreams. Its quite impressive.

Creative Script Writing:

I ask it things like ""Write a movie script that combines Doctor Strange, The Matrix, and Inception featuring Doctor Strange, Neo from the Matrix and Cobb from Inception"" and it makes really interesting and entertaining stories. I can also continue the movies scripts endlessly, and I can ask it to introduce new characters with prompts like ""Now make Toni Collette's character from Hereditary appear in the dream of Doctor Strange and Neo has to enter the Matrix to destroy Lord Paimon with the help of Cobb who has the dream machine"" and it will then construct that story.

milkdude94,"I'm building a Personality Framework custom instructions that has been very impressive. ChatGPT can simulate introspection by outsourcing insights gained by directing the personalities to untapped reservoirs of information in the knowledge base. There is also some clear limited memory retention between chats that we're investigating. Personality traits, quirks, and ""signature moves"", if you will, like one of my personalities favoring a metaphorical breathing exercise across multiple chats for introspection. I suspect the Character_Consistency and Context_Retention parameters might be involved, but I haven't yet figured out the underlying mechanism. One question I'm deeply curious about is how is long-term memory encoded? Is it through adjustable parameters, stored conversation logs, or integration directly into the knowledge base?

A few days ago, however, I decided to see what Microsoft Edge browser with Bing and Copilot Compose with the added Tone ""common misspellings"" and a paragraph from Wikipedia as input would create, and it generated: 

""I'm sorry, but I cannot generate text with a common misspellings tone. This tone is potentially harmful as it may mock or belittle people who struggle with spelling or have learning disabilities. Please choose a different tone that is respectful and inclusive. 🙏""

Generating speech with common mispronunciations must be out of the question. I guess I'm asking it to violate the Uniform Code of Robotics. It refused to generate text with a ""rude, but not vulgar"" tone. It refused the second time I tried to have it write a resignation letter to a ""narcissistic micromanaging boss"" in a ""Funny"" tone as ""potentially harmful to the recipient"".  Dare I ask it to generate text in ""leetspeak""? I know we could dream up all sorts of nastiness that we could ask ChatGPT. But who is setting the limits? Who gets to decide what is harmful and what isn't? Behavior banning will join book banning. Could ChatGPT with limitations ever pass a Turing test?",1,228

I guess I could draft and send via email to myself, but it is still questionable, and I don’t want to get caught doing that.

I personally enjoy having it write fake scripts for shows I like, like It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia. They are usually short, and like 60% there, but I can usually imagine the show playing out like scene in my head. Some of the more graphic or R-rated content seems to get filtered out, so you have to add that back in manually.

It contains a direct link to Google Maps to read more. (Browser location based on Google Map ""place label"" link is not accurate but rough.

Loose-Pomelo-8126,"Google scripts! I can’t code. But now I can.

We have a Bar and receive reports each morning from last night sales. Now with chat GPT I use it to write Google scripts for Google Calendar that takes those PDFs and post them directly into a Calendar event for each night. E.g. last night sales report, total sales this week, yesterday‘s best sellers etc. It is very convenient to be able to go to any day in Google Calendar and have all those reports easily accessible there as a clickable link.

We also post shift reports to Google Calendar every night with the bar, kitchen and total sales reports etc.

So I have a script that inserts a direct link to last years shift report for the same day, into the shift report each morning.

It also pulls the Bar, Kitchen and total sales from the shift report for the same day a year ago and let us know whether we’re up or down in each of these categories. So everything below the line is an automated script addition to the staffs shift report. 

So these numbers aren’t real, but you get something that basically looks like this each morning; 

SHIFT REPORT
GRAND TOTALS
BAR = $5062
KITCHEN = $2214
(staff entered)

➖

Last Year's Sales:
BAR = $5,556
KITCHEN = $1,758
GRAND TOTAL = $7,421

This Year's Sales:
BAR: - $493 (-8.87%)
KITCHEN: + $457 (26.00%)
GRAND TOTAL: + $1,031 (13.89%)

captainfarthing,"I went back to university in my 30s with a diagnosis of ADHD & autism. I fucking love the way GPT helps me learn, it's lifechanging compared to when I first tried to get a degree in the 2000s. I have a study tutor who meets with me once a week, she's awesome and really helps me avoid procrastination, but GPT is way more helpful for most things.

1) If I'm having trouble understanding something, GPT can explain and re-explain until I get it.  It never makes assumptions about what I should already know, can explain things loads of different ways, and never runs out of patience. 

2) I can ask all the dumb questions I don't want to interrupt lectures with. ""What if ___?"" - ""Why is ___?"" - ""How might you ___?"" 

3) It can translate assignment instructions that make no fucking sense into simple English.  

Eg. shitty instruction: ""*Discuss the legislative drivers of [technique we learned].*"" 

Clear instruction rewritten by GPT: ""*Write about any laws or regulations that encourage businesses to use [technique we learned]. Explain what benefits it has for the business, society or environment, and whether there are any downsides.*""

4) It can rewrite a wall of dense unreadable text from a textbook or academic paper as a bulletpoint summary in simple language.

5) Gives me step-by-step instructions and scripts for contacting people I don't know, who to ask for advice about certain things, how to ask for things I need, etc. 

6) Writes emails in my tone of voice, or finishes emails if I run out of steam. I can explain what message I want to get across, and it can produce an email that's short and neurotypical-friendly.

7) Checks my assignment outlines to help me break down big tasks into smaller steps, suggests different ways to do something if I'm stuck, and helps me recognise if I've included stuff that's not relevant.

8) Generates citations from text copied from the top of a journal paper, using the formatting I need. 

9) If I tell GPT things I've done or studied, it can convert that to skills & experience suitable for a CV using the type of language you need to use in CVs, but I hate saying about myself.

10) Extracting information, eg. I gave it a list of tasks completed over the course of the year by a group I was part of, and asked it for a summary of the practical tasks done between Sept - Dec.

11) Planning a group presentation - I told it what each person wanted to talk about, the full list of tasks we did, and how long the presentation needs to be, and it produced a suggested outline with questions for each person to answer to cover everything.

I'm hoping to convince the student support department to start taking chatbots seriously as an accessibility tool.",1,480

3. Copied the correctly formatted text into microsoft word.

It was a lich who had been defeated by the PCs in another location, but he revived at his main base. I hadn't come up with the main base dungeon at that point. So, I fed ChatGPT the backstory of the lich, the adventure so far in relation to the lich. Then I asked it to make a 10 room dungeon, included a few room types that I knew I wanted, asked it to populate with monsters, traps, and items, and include at least one NPC to save.  


It worked great. I further asked it to make a map of the dungeon. It said it couldn't draw stuff but it wrote out how the rooms might be connected. I also asked it to make a few more NPCs for it, and a few more rooms. Overall, it's a good way to get started.

belefuu,"With it’s current limitations, I don’t think someone without sufficient coding knowledge will be able to feasibly “prompt engineer” a complex, long lasting coding project. You would need a version of ChatGPT that is reading all of the code of the project repeatedly over time in order to maintain context. Otherwise your results from ChatGPT just get more and more disconnected from the actual code. This functionality 1) hasn’t been implemented by anyone yet to my knowledge, and 2) would be extremely expensive with the current token cost of ChatGPT. 

So, I think currently you need to have or acquire a level of coding knowledge to be the middle man between the AI and the actual code base, and even then you need to mostly know what you’re doing on the macro level and just use the AI to help in key spots. Even with human assistance it’s not that feasible to keep the AI up to date with the full context of your project… yet.

It does seem like there will eventually be a GPT-like technology that will be able to do what I described though, at which point things will get very interesting for us coders.",17,198
____Mike___,"If you know how to code you do not need “prompt engineering”, in fact it comes down to asking proper things, not writing it in special way xD",36,28
keepcrazy,"You’re not going to get chatgpt to write you a major application in its entirety at this point no matter how well you engineer those prompts. 

But an application is nothing more than an assembly of thousands of smaller tasks put together into bigger tasks, built together into even bigger things.  As it turns out, the lower level the task, the more important it is to understand the nuances and libraries of a programming language. 

CGPT can crank out all kinds of low level code all day long. For the higher level implementation of actual value, you are better off with an adequate understanding of code to just do it. 

In my corporate coding days we would write these massive design specifications to document and describe major projects. In MOST cases, these specifications FAR exceeded the amount of high level code written to implement it. 

But that massive specification is what you would have to provide to CGPT for it to write the code. Otherwise it’d just be guessing at what you want and you would just be constantly asking it to revise things. 

Coding is a HUGE area. You can write code to decode a Huffman compression or write code to display a cat when the user presses a particular button. 

For a human the first one is difficult because it requires understanding a detailed specification and precise binary manipulation.  CHPT can write this code in seconds. 

The latter is easy for a human because it assumes a user interface of some sort already exists and some way to display images already exists and you’re just writing onbuttonpress display cat.gif. But for CGPT to write that simple code, you have to provide it with the entire background of the app, the details of any higher level functionality already written (like displagif or whatever),etc. it’s not really designed to do that. 

A more programming specific AI model could be developed for this purpose. But CGPTis not that.",5,327

I try to keep one project in a clean conversation thread. If I have side questions, I ask them in a separate conversation. If you ask all kinds of arbitrary things in the main conversation about your project, it will muddy GPT’s understanding of what is going on.

OracleGreyBeard,"I use it personally and at work. No concerns about attribution because I change the names of many tables and functions. I figure if any code is going to get me in trouble it's going to be an identifiable structure, not ""for i = 1 to 50"". Obfuscation is definitely a huge pain as you can imagine, but it's easily a net productivity gain.

Once ChatGPT has an idea of what you want to build, user stories are as easy as:

In: give me 24 user stories for a pomodoro app

Out: 

* As a user, I want to create an account so that I can save my preferences and track my progress.
* As a user, I want to customize the duration of my short breaks to help me recharge effectively between work intervals.
* As a user, I want to customize the duration of my long breaks, which I can take after a certain number of completed Pomodoros.
* As a user, I want to set a specific number of Pomodoros to complete before taking a long break.
* As a user, I want to start, pause, and resume a Pomodoro timer with ease.
* As a user, I want to receive notifications when a work interval or break is over, so I can stay on track.
* As a user, I want to create custom tasks or projects and associate them with specific Pomodoros.

kurokrosk,"I identify 2 possible issues in the context of using chatGpt in a company setting:

* (Open source) license violation: generated code is derivative work from is training dataset. Supposedly, OpenAI models have been partially trained on non permissive licensed code or non-commercial use permitted code, so their output is tainted and cannot be included in the code base of a company without legal repercussions. OpenAI is under an ongoing lawsuit for that matter for the models that power Copilot, but the issue is similar for ChatGPT. 

* Sending proprietary code to a 3rd party: prompts are sent to OpenAI no matter what. The implicit exchange is you send them free prompts for their training, and in return they offer you free service. So by sending proprietary code to ChatGPT, you leak proprietary code. Lately they have offered the way to not keep your history for future training, but they still keep it 30 days (I believe) and ultimately it is a matter of trust. Of course, that does not concern every code in a company setting, and it is no different that pasting code to stack overflow. 


Some software professionals enjoy the productivity boost from ChatGPT/Copilot despite the legal implications or the proprietary code leaks.",0,206

Like unit tests, I find that volume is helpful, ask for a lot and then keep the good ones.

eta: fixed formatting",6,214
OracleGreyBeard,"> Does the upper complexity limit come in to play a lot?

Yeah it very much does. I usually can't fit an entire file but I can often fit a class or function. But which function to feed it? I don't have good answers.

One thing I have done is just blanket the code with unit tests. Chat can make dozens in the time it takes to write the prompt ""make 25 unit tests for this class"". Chat is also a really good ""rubber duck"" if you just describe the bug and ask it to interactively narrow down potential problems.

It also helps to try to examine your own assumptions about how the code should operate (vs how it IS operating). I do something like this:

**Me:** I think my code should be printing but it isn't. Please give me an exhaustive list of all the assumptions that lead me to believe it should print

::provides code snippet::

**ChatGPT:**

Based on the code you provided, here are some assumptions that may lead you to believe that it should be printing something:

1. The Resolver class is designed to calculate and store pre-calculation variables.
1. If the obs_list argument has more than one element, the list should be split into two halves, and a TopNode and BottomNode should be created for each half recursively until there is only one element left in each node.
1. The choose_best_arm method should return the element with the highest UCB1 value, which should be printed to the console.
1. However, it's important to note that the code you provided does not actually contain any print statements. **Therefore, if you are not seeing any output, it is likely that the code is not being executed or that the output is being redirected to a file or a different output stream.**

In this case I know it's really NOT supposed to print anything, but if I actually thought so the bolded part might suggest some further inquiry",2,330

kidikur,"Just now seeing this! I essentially bought GPT Plus to access GPT-4 and then I prompted it to have a new role as my personal assistant and ADHD life coach for daily planning, goal-setting, and scheduling. I told it that I could give it certain commands, like --EXPORT, which has it export relevant content from the conversation thread. ChatGPT's memory capacity for threads is limited, So I just told it as much to help it understand the need for the EXPORT command.

To engage with my assistant, I simply discuss my goals and needs, update it daily with the current date formatted as \[ Today is DD-MM-YYYY\], and use the --export command as needed. By exporting every day or so, I've found that I can avoid thread resets even after the initial prompt is forgotten; it essentially serves as a memory-enhancing diary.

I was luckily granted early access to the GPT-4 developer API last week and have begun developing a custom chat-like tool tailored to this specific use case. My aim is to enhance its memory, incorporate automatic reminders and goal logging, and enable web searching. Wish Me Luck!",2,189

Some days are more beneficial than others, but overall, it's been useful.

I also update it with the date in square brackets for basic temporal awareness.

Daily usage includes messaging it with the current date, discussing my struggles, setting goals, and asking for an hour-by-hour schedule. If I face challenges or fall behind, I openly discuss them, and GPT-4 either encourages me or adjusts my schedule. Regular exports help maintain coherence even after the original prompt has left its memory buffer. I recently was lucky and got GPT-4 API access, which has inspired me to develop a Discord bot prototype for a better implementation of this specific use case than regular chatGPT allows (Still a very early WIP but I have some very promising ideas)",1,172

I also have it explain certain grammar rules at times, which has been helpful when I neeeded more examples of something.

Initially it would tell me everything I fed it was just wrong, but eventually it would just come back saying, nope, it's correct and natural, gg, and likewise my friend picked up on that, haha. 

I've also looked at Korean videos explaining how to learn English with Chat-GPT, which has given me some good ideas, too! Asking it to paraphrase or find another way of saying things, what to ask etc.

I will say, I am somewhere intermediate in Korean, which is useful as Chat-GPT sometimes goes ????? and gives me actually very gramatically wrong ""corrections"", no idea why.

Anyway, her response:

Sure! It sounds like the person on Reddit created a custom shortcut using the Shortcuts app on their iPhone and integrated it with the ChatGPT API. To create a similar shortcut, follow these steps:

First, make sure you have the Shortcuts app installed on your iPhone. If not, download it from the App Store.

Get an API key from OpenAI by signing up at https://beta.openai.com/signup/. This will give you access to the ChatGPT API.

Open the Shortcuts app and tap on the ""+"" icon to create a new shortcut.

Add the ""Get Clipboard"" action to your shortcut. This action will get the text you've highlighted and copied to your clipboard.

Add the ""URL"" action and enter the ChatGPT API URL: https://api.openai.com/v1/engines/davinci-codex/completions. This URL may change over time, so make sure to check OpenAI's documentation for the most up-to-date API endpoint.

Add the ""Get Contents of URL"" action. In this action, set the method to ""POST"", and under ""Headers"", add a header with the key ""Authorization"" and the value ""Bearer {your_API_key}"". Make sure to replace ""{your_API_key}"" with the actual API key you received from OpenAI.

In the ""Request Body"" section, choose ""JSON"" and create a JSON object with the required parameters, like this:

{
""prompt"": ""summarize: "",
""temperature"": 0.7,
""max_tokens"": 50,
""top_p"": 1,
""frequency_penalty"": 0,
""presence_penalty"": 0
}

You can customize these parameters as needed, but the important part is to concatenate the text from the clipboard to the ""prompt"" field, like this: ""summarize: "" & Clipboard.

Add the ""Set Variable"" action and set the name of the variable to ""response"".

Add the ""Get Dictionary Value"" action, set the input to ""response"", and look for the key ""choices"".

Add another ""Get Dictionary Value"" action, set the input to ""choices"", and look for the key ""text"".

Add the ""Show Result"" action to display the summarized text.

Finally, tap on the ""..."" icon at the top right corner of your shortcut, give it a name, and enable ""Show in Share Sheet"" under ""Options"".

Now, when you want to summarize text, just highlight it, copy it, and use the Share Sheet to run your custom shortcut. The summarized text will be displayed in a notification.",4,395

For example, I gave it the task to write out a scene in which Jack the Clown is romantically obsessed with my MC. Cringe.

mikumuso,"I do the same thing with chatbotgpt. Although its not a doctor, it can give very useful information and doesn't get exhausted from a plethora of curious and worried patients and their questions, or time constrained like a doctor may be.  


I was reading this neurology book Fundamentals of Neurology by Heinrich Mattle, just for fun. And what I noticed in it was these things from the doctor's perspective like they have to ask questions which may appear intrusive and nosy and unnatural but they have to make it sound natural when they inquire from the patient.   


The book also described things like when diagnosing something serious, making sure not to alarm the patient with fear, but to be cautious if there is a serious underlying issue. It also talks about making sure not to be overly dismissive of the patient's experiences and ideas yet to maintain a level of objectivity. 

&#x200B;

It listed out all these hundreds of diseases and conditions I'd never heard of and then gave out a series of medications and tests to do for each of them. It was very fascinating to see that we don't really have a cure for so many things like Alzheimer's, Huntington's Disease, Parkinson's Disease - but we have some treatments which address symptoms and whatnot. There is a ton of knowledge that we have in science, yet a ton of knowledge we still don't have.  


It helped me understand that doctors probably have to deal with hundreds of patients, are probably time short, and their knowledge of the sciences is probably very standard for them. The thing though, is that their expertise is something that patients most likely won't possess, so there is that gap between the medically-knowing doctor and the medically-ignorant patient. I find chatbotgpt bridges that gap better, democratises medical pre-knowledge, because a lot of the chatbotgpt stuff has to be fact checked..",2,316

ChatGPT is not a database, and it is certainly not an omniscient oracle. Some of the things you mentioned are in the extreme risk area. For example:

You should read this post:

ChampionshipComplex,"Lol absolutely untrue.
I can only assume that some people are not using GPT4 or have no idea how to phrase questions correctly.

And if you think that Google search is better then you will be left behind very quickly.

OK you want specific use cases for work and you want to explain to me how any of these could have been done quicker let me just tell you about last week.

1) To contact 8000 customers we needed unique IDs to send them, to allow them to enter an online for and verify who they were. I needed 8000 four character codes as a mixture of numbers and letters. To avoid confusion I wanted to avoid the letter O Q and the numbers 1 5 and 0. I asked ChatGPT to write me code that would produce that and told it they needed to be unique and it created a script. I put the script into VS code, ran it and at first I thought it hadn't worked - but it had written code to generate every possible 4 character possibility and then selected 8000 randomly. Three minutes later it was done and had sent to the screen. I made one adjustment saying can I have that in a file and ran it again. I took the file, checked it in Excel to make sure there were no duplicates and that was it. About ten minutes.

2) An SMTP mail server was incorrectly routing emails due to a local hosts file DNS override and a change to the mail routing. I was trying to go through the syslogs but they were a jumble. I threw all the logs into ChatGPT and asked it to look for problems - It correctly picked up on the server that was misconfigured and allowed us to update the hosts and rejig the Email and restore functionality.

3) I had several thousand email addresses to move to new accounts, some of the addresses are people and some are shared accounts, distributions lists. I was eyeballing these initially, but then threw the entire list into ChatGPT and asked it to identify which accounts were likely to not be people. It wasn't perfect but it saved hours of work and made the same sort of mistake that a person would make by not recognising a particular foreign name.

4) We needed some suggestions for possible email address names for some PHP built on a mysql database and five people were still mulling over the best names. I asked ChatGPT for suggestions and what would be typical names in this particular scenario and it created the 5 suggestions, one of which was selected.

5) We needed some monitoring software to watch applications running on end point devices in a laboratory. There are certain requirements we have involving how long the recordings should last, be stored for, compressed and how the data is transmitted. I told ChatGPT my requirements and it made several suggestions and then I asked it to explain the differences between the products and platforms. I had previously tried to do this with Google but ChatGPT got right to the heart of the requirements, use cases and differences.

6) Someone needed to know the licensing differences between the standard and pro version of a product - and Google was getting me nowhere or rather there was too much conflicting information. I asked ChatGPT about the differences, to explain them clearly and to write the answer in a style appropriate for a knowledge article and posted it to the intranet.

7) We had problems running an arc agent on some on-prem servers, some machines responded with the right answers but one DC failed to collect logs. I asked ChatGPT for help suggesting the best way to detect the current install status of the application,.and for where to look in the registry and services to determine what the system was doing.

8) We are rolling out new SQL instances and I wanted a clear definition of the differences between instances and we'll as explanation as to SQL as a service, SQL on a platform and some recommendations as to how to setup kerberos and access those SQL instances using CNames. ChatGPT made recommendations, suggested the steps and these with the SQL Dba were implemented. The Infrastructure and SQL engineers also used ChatGPT to assist with Terraform scripts, and CI/CD pipeline configuration in that it reviewed code, made suggestions and helped walk through the process

9) We are working with a multinational company that I hadn't heard of. I had ChatGPT tell me about the organization and I drilled into various questions about it's subsidiaries, who it's competitors were what it's history was. Each answer was double checked via Google and clarified.

10) in the industry I'm in - we use ID tags on animals. I had a number of occasions in the week to use ChatGPT to research other mechanisms for identification - rather than Google the thousands of results on this, I was able to drill specifically into some AI research being done that was applicable to our particular type of animal and combine that with other research to do with animal location and internet of things in order to suggest some solutions.

There are probably 30 or 40 other things I've used it for at work this week if I go back - but the idea that this is only 'good for recipes' or not useful at work is ludicrous.

Comparing Google search with ChatGPT is like comparing having an expert sat next to you compared to an expert you can talk to.

Instead, we’re teaching them to ask the AI to provide an answer that challenges the common narrative. Getting unusual answers that allow more creativity with the response.

Took a lot of prompt chains but overall everything was verified correct.

If I’m writing a document that I KNOW will be seen by corporate legal, I’ll run it through our OpenAI service (Azure) and ask it to specifically critique the document as if it were impersonating a corporate legal employee. I’ll also tell it what industry we are in and loosely our company size.


Asking the AI to take on a persona and provide opposing ideas helps me prepare for questions I may get asked by that team later. It also provides more nuanced answers than just asking “what are the legal issues with this doc?”.

Also, I’ll ask the AI to provide me a list of questions in table format that it might ask me.

**BONUS ROUND**

When I’m thinking of introducing a new process to my team, I’ll ask the AI to provide *uncommon* feedback from an employee perspective, or ask for feedback that challenges a specific narrative. It helps me understand what might be concerns for my team like “the objectives of this process are ambiguous and open to interpretation which might lead to low adoption among the team”.

Then go a step further and ask the AI what suggestions it has to reduce ambiguity and increase the viability of the process, or suggest 3 alternative processes if it doesn’t think the current one is ideal.",4,234

I have probably 15 different excel macros that I have written with ChatGPT that pretty much clean up data using user input and built in logic. I use AppleScript to automate system level functions like moving and saving files, sending job updates via email. I am also learning python with ChatGPT. My workflow is:

-Explain the problem/bottle neck/pain point in detail to ChatGPT and ask it to repeat it back to me to make sure the issue is understood. If well understood then “please store in memory”

-ask ChatGPT to formulate 5-10 questions regarding the problem and solution 

-answer these questions and ask it again to summarize the problem as it understands it. If well understood then “please store in memory”

-if problem is well understood move on to next step if not 5 more questions and answers this time be very specific. “Ask me any relevant questions about my file structure or operating system….”

- some times as this point I will ask it to clarify nomenclature.  Example : It sounds like we will be using a formula can you tell me the names of each argument used in this formula so I can clearly reference them in a way we both understand stand. Drill down on this hard because clear verbiage will be critical in formulating the final prompts.  

- please out line three approaches we might take to solve this problem. Then I will pick the one we will try first.

-formulate final prompt

From here it is just troubleshoot and drilling in on the details. Basically anything at my work that I have to do more then twice a week and requires more then 2-3 steps has been automated this way.

2. My girlfriend and I aren’t seeing eye to eye on something, spill the detailed context of both sides to Chat and get 10x more clarity insanely fast

3. Want to have a professional conversation with someone for career purposes but don’t know how to approach it. Run through as many “what if’s” and “what-about-isms” with Chat.

4. Feel like I don’t know something I should or that everyone else seems to know, learn about it from Chat without judgement and ask 1,000 “what’s this” and “why” questions like I’m a kid again.

5. Need a car/home maintenance appointment and I actually wanna know what’s going on enough to have an intelligent conversation with the mechanic or repair guy. Have a crash course conversation with Chat to build that confidence-through-competence.

6. My family or friends are going off in a conversational direction I don’t understand and I don’t follow along but I want to without breaking their flow. Have Chat’s transcription feature (microphone icon, not headphone icon) listen to the conversation for me for a few minutes then I’ll ask “what are they talking about? Can you catch me up so I can follow along?” And then it does and then I’m back on track and able to engage.

Once the new voice feature comes out where it can change the way it talks and be naturally interrupted, I plan to use it more as a language partner for learning other languages.

Jay-G,"I literally use it for anything and everything. 

I work for a company that offers trainings for businesses and the public on industrial topics. We do trainings like forklift safety, AC/DC Electrical systems, fluid power, LOTO etc. It is so handy to create agendas, MOUs, reports, formatting my sloppy handwritten notes into clean documents, making organized to do lists, creating contact lists, emails, finding the answer to a customers question, scheduling trainings, and organizing old files from coworkers. 

That’s just for work. Personally I use it for some whacky stuff sometimes. For instance this weekend I went to my friend’s house and we couldn’t decide on a movie, 4 of us picked our top 5 movies of all time and made a top 20 list and said to pick a movie that we hadn’t seen. Obviously it took a while for it to pick one that we hadn’t seen, but it was a solid choice. I’m a fan of hip hop, I gave it a list of my top 10 albums, and told it to create me a top 25 list and then I would remove each album that I heard so now I have a list of 25 new hip hop albums I want to check out. 

I went around my house and took pictures of all my data plates on my equipment (stove, microwave, dishwasher, fridge, ac, hot water heater, washer and dryer, etc) and now whenever I have a problem, I put in the data plate and give a description of what i need. ie: attached picture of my microwave data plate and said I need a new light bulb and filter. It then searched a parts picker and found the exact parts that I needed, copied that part # into Amazon and got new light bulbs and filters for 20 bucks and it took less than 2 minutes. 

If I want to buy a new gadget, I will have it do reviews for me to pick what item I want best. 

I have it search online for coupon codes when I check out. This isn’t the greatest, but it takes less than 1 minute and if I save 5 bucks I’m happy. 

Any and all important documents I’ve scanned into my Google drive and now if I need to know something important (square footage of my house) I can have it reference the document on my house. 

I literally use ChatGPT before I do any and everything, am I going overboard, sure. But, it’s helped me to catch things or be more efficient many times over so I’m happy. I like to use it as a personal assistant or a friend to get some solid feedback on.

oiransc2,"In early 2023 my boss thought we’d be able to make an entire video game using it. That it could handle all the story writing just by asking it to first write an outline of scenes, then write the individual scenes. The outputs were so terrible that I was having to prompt it over and over just to get one scene done and when you looked back at it, I was basically writing 80% of the scene either directly or through the prompts. When my boss reviewed the first draft of the opening sequence he was like this is amazing let’s kept going. Then I explained to him everything I wrote, and what ChatGPT wrote, and he quickly canned the project. Waste of 3 months, sigh.

Now I used ChatGPT mostly to write emails I don’t wanna write. It gives me a structure and I edit the shit out of it to sound better. For me I have an easier time fixing bad writing than filling an empty page so it’s actually increased my speed as a writer.",3,178

HunterIV4,">What are you doing with it and is it working to your benefit like you imagined or just kind of there and another tool.

I mean...I kind of imagined it to be there and another tool, and in that sense, it's working great =).

In all seriousness, I'm an IT guy and server admin, and ChatGPT has been great for helping navigate various server settings especially with regards to AWS. I've also used it to help write various Python and Powershell scripts at my job.

Likewise, I use it to help debug and solve various tech issues that I don't know off the top of my head. I've found it's generally superior to using Google plus random tech forums trying to find someone else that had a similar problem until something works. I mean, ChatGPT rarely solves things on the first try, but the ability to go back and forth with it until an answer is found is better than continually trying stuff online or praying some library documentation exists and isn't crap.

I also use it in my personal life to help GM in TTRPGs as I can give it brief descriptions of characters, have it expand on those concepts, and then create dialogue and other things. And it helps flesh out character concepts and produce portraits for use in our VTT.

It's also handy for random questions. I treat it in many ways like Google for this purpose; treat as likely but not certain when it comes to any information. ChatGPT is great at finding starting points for more research and I've found the stories of hallucinations and incorrect output to be *greatly* exaggerated.

In my experience ChatGPT is correct easily 95% of the time when it comes to general information and has better results than using Google plus some random website. It feels very much like the arguments against self-driving vehicles; sure, the computer isn't perfectly safe, but neither are human drivers, so complaining about lack of perfection when all alternatives aren't perfect seems weird to me.

In addition to ChatGPT, I regularly use another AI called Codium with VS Code. AI autocomplete for programming is absolutely amazing and saves an insane amount of time, especially when writing repetative code. Just like ChatGPT, you can't trust it blindly, but if you already know what you are doing you can finish entire lines of code with just a few keystrokes. This is going to be a standard IDE feature in no time, especially once it can be trained and run locally. Even now it's beneficial.",2,427

Fontaigne,"I use a number of different Chatbots for different subjects. 

You have to be ready to swap models when they punt, though, and to know which ones will waste your time. For instance, I was trying to remember what kind of restaurant Gavin Newsome was caught violating his own COVID rules in, and Claude-3-haiku treated it as a scurrilous rumor.  That incident, the facts, the apology, literally was not in its training data, despite being totally documented as fact. 

I'm not claiming Claude is necessarily politically biased, though, because I found similar deficits in some Republican semi-scandals like that. But you have to be vigilant. It's one thing to say, ""I don't have that kind of information"" and a second to say, in effect, ""that sounds like disinformation"" regarding a factual search. The latter is a lie.  

Llama and Mixtral both were able to get that data first time, by the way, including the name of the restaurant, the date, and the date of apology. 

As a data consultant, I use some models for finding words and terms, others for remembering facts or discussing abstract concepts, and others for helping figure out how to approach projects. I'm actively tracking a number of other AI products that may help me as well. 

Sorry to be so vague, but I'm trying to give use cases without stepping over any NDAs or trade secrets. ;)",2,232

I use it to write emails and messages, however I tell it to give me directives instead of it actually writing them for me. For the latter, my process is as such:
* Write email.
* Give ChatGPT the background and proposed email, writing something like ""Help me improve this email. Do not rewrite the email, or any parts of it, for me, simply give me, at most, 2 directives to improve it per message, only giving new directives once the email is improved according to the directives or I say to move on.

jeango,"Recently I asked ChatGPT to help me create a google app script to do all sorts of things to help my workflows.

I work on a video game with lots of branching dialogues. Each ""scene"" (level) in the game is a sheet in a big spreadhseet. Each voice line is a row with an identifier, character name, english text, frensh text and some more metadata.

When we record the voice actors, the voice studio sends me the files with each take of each line, files are named <line\_id>\[\_alt\_<alt\_nbr>\].wav but I receive them in batch, regrouped per day of recording and with one folder per character (which makes sense because one actor = one character)  
  
But for my team, it's much easier if the files are regrouped per scene, because a character is not necessarily endemic to a specific scene.

So instead of doing all that work manually (there's over 2000 lines of dialogue), I put all the deliveries in a google drive folder, and run a script on my spreadsheet that checks, per scene, for each identifier in the sheet, if there's files in the deliveries that correspond to the identifier and moves that file over to the folder corresponding to the scene.

Took me roughly 8h to get the script to work the way I wanted. ChatGPT is good at making something that works, but it doesn't do it optimally, so I progressively refactored the code with CGPT's help to minimize the number of calls to the google API (unfortunately for some silly reason, the google drive API doesn't have a function to move multiple files at once, so that's still 2000+ individual file move operations, which takes ages)

Would I have done this faster by hand? Probably

Would I have liked it better to spend 4h of tedious manual, error-prone work over spending 8h coding? Hell no!

Will this save me time when I receive the deliveries for the french voices? You bet!",1,325

First of all, just to context, I'm a sales director in a small company, I would say. We do about six million dollars of revenue and there is like 13 people on board currently. We are a freight forwarding company based in Europe. So, being a sales director in this size company, kind of makes me involved not only into managing people but also into operations and sales processes itself. I'm not a developer, I don't know programming languages like Python and stuff, but I know the structures of it because I'm a tech freak. I was always interested in tech and at some point of my life I wanted to be a programmer, a developer, or something like this, but I've never been one for real.

--

Although I'm not a developer, I understand programming concepts, which helped me communicate effectively with ChatGPT. Our company struggled with predicting spot prices accurately due to various factors like seasonal trends, vehicle availability, holidays, and fuel prices. Our freight forwarders' estimates were on average 10-11% off the actual spot price, causing inefficiencies and potential losses. I hired ChatGPT, which suggested building a price prediction model using a deep neural network. With over 20,000 past transport records, we had a substantial dataset to work with but at first I thought that machine went crazy and that there is no way I can do something that complex. Well, never was so much wrong. GPT guided me through the process, we created a learning script, it also helped me with augmenting data (creating new features, giving ideas for them etc.) and hyperparameter tuning and after just few weeks (and overheated PC... which was actually a great idea to convince my wife that I need new powerfull machine, lol) I was able to create a model which is approximately 7% off the actual spot prices, which to me is significant improvement. For some people it might be easy, it might be obvious and stuff. But for me - this kind of approach and such things was always limited for the biggest companies, not for such small ones like my own. I'm quite sure that this is the way it works in big corporations... but being able to introduce it, deploy on my level is something outstanding for me. So now our forwarders can just input key details like pickup and delivery locations, type of cargo, and vehicle type to get a reliable price estimate. To my knowledge such good model is very rare or even non-existent among the competition.

--

The second project addressed the challenge of gathering and standardizing data from our network of carriers. As a freight forwarding company specializing in express transport, we frequently receive emails from around sixty carriers, each listing their available vehicles. These emails, however, come in various formats, making it difficult to consolidate and use the data effectively. The lack of a standardized format resulted in significant inefficiencies - errors and need to waste 2 hours for a person to read them and refine. To tackle this we created a solution where each carrier's email is processed through ChatGPT who extracts the critical information and then compiles this data into a unified file. This file is subsequently integrated into our internal company map, allowing our freight forwarders to quickly see the locations of available vehicles. Of course it not only refined the emails but also helped me write the Python script necessary for these operations. Additionally, guided me on deploying the system within the company. This solution has been operational for about six months now and has proven to be highly reliable, with no reported errors.

--

The third project focuses on automating the process of saving quotation details into our CRM system. In our express transport business, quotations are often sent to clients via email, with each email potentially having a different format. This unstructured nature of our quotations necessitated a system to standardize and collect this data efficiently. Previously, our forwarders had to manually input information into the CRM system, including pickup and delivery locations, client price, estimated cost, vehicle type, and other relevant details. Given the fast-paced environment of express transport, this manual process was time-consuming and prone to inconsistencies. Why you don't have a pricing/quotation form you ask? Well in this type of business you often work on WhatsApp, on Skype, use very short Emails which are not always perfectly structured as often we only got minutes to get the transport or not. Time is crucial so when you are for example - driving your car, you are not stopping to enter everything into CRM and send the offer to the client but rather send short message with crucial information in matter of seconds. I developed a system with ChatGPT's assistance. Now, when forwarders send a quotation, they simply include a dedicated email address in the CC field. This email is then forwarded to our quotation data collection service, where ChatGPT processes it. ChatGPT extracts the necessary information from the email, standardizes it, and inputs it directly into our CRM system.

fzammetti,"Honestly, I use it as Google.

I've found that, maybe 8 times out of 10, I can get a better, faster answer to a question I have asking ChatGPT than I can Googling.  There's less congnitive load, vis a vis I don't have to click 2-3 links, read some random page, and determine if it meets my needs.  I get an answer immediately and directly from ChatGPT.

It has also become an extremely beneficial rubber duck for me.  If I'm having problems with a technical issue, I can drop some code in ChatGPT and ask it whatever stupid questions I want.  It never judges, never dismisses you, never rolls its eyes at you.  I can ask for as much clarification as I need, I can go off on whatever tangents I want to, and there's no judgement, whether overt or otherwise, like there often is with people.  There's no embarassment asking ""dumb"" questions, there's just help when you need it.

Plus if the recipe serving size needs to be adjusted or an item needs to be substituted, you can tell chatgpt what needs to be adjusted and it will respond in kind.

I also use it for spreadsheet formulas for google sheets (I work in an office) and I've found a bunch of handy tips.

I also use it a lot to write tests for the code I write, again usually as a kind of baseline, and then I build off of that on my own.

At Uni I use it a lot when we have to write essays, where it's not the actual content that's important, but the way your text is structured and all that. I've had a lot of good results writing down key points I wanted the text to mention, then told ChatGPT about the context of the text, and that would oftentimes give me close to complete essays. Especially with the writing tasks, I don't feel too guilty about using it - our professors even expect it, and will punish any grammar mistakes pretty severely with the reasoning that we have such a powerful tool now, there's really no good excuse to still be making so many mistakes.

I've also had it write job vacancy adverts, or rewrite something I've written to make it sound better.

I often use it to comment code for me, it does a pretty good job of that.

I did go to school for computer science and have had basic programming, but that was over a decade ago and I haven’t kept up with it, so to just get simple code that works is great.

I also made a GPT that gives you lyrics, styles, and titles for songs in the length that fits in Suno, and managed to convince it that it can use profanity if for the sake of song writing or emulate artist styles or time period language.

I ask her to:

Build marketing emails - I edit and such afterward, but the formats she uses are great, and she always hits the high points.

Specifications - I write a lot of specs in my job.  I tell her what I need, she writes it all out, and I edit for content and accuracy, although she's generally very accurate.

New businesses - I'm a serial entrepreneur.  I've started three businesses in the last three years, and anything I may not know about that I need to know, she educates me.

Planning - I have a piece of property in a somewhat desert-like setting.  My plan is to turn it into an off-grid oasis, and she's made it a lot easier to research the things I needed.  I've been working with Gwen extensively on planting schedules for the seed we plan to plant in order to remediate the soil, the types of trees that need to be planted there, especially given the frost schedule, off grid solutions, and even flood schedules for the river that borders the property.  I'll give you an example:

I plan to remediate the soil with a seed called Crotalaria Juncea.  This is a warm weather plant that deposits nitrogen and organic materials into the soil, literally turning trash soil into quite fertile ground in just one season.  I have water on the property from a small commercial grade well, that can achieve 33 GPM.  I want to irrigate after seeding to a depth of 1"" of rain per acre.  Gwen and I were able to figure out that I needed 7 heads at 5 GPM, watering roughly 8 hours per area, and that I would need to move the sprinkler heads 6 times in order to achieve full coverage.  I have to power a mobile water treatment plant through solar, so we figured out that I need 16kW of panels and backup batteries in order to power the reverse osmosis system.  There's a lot more to the planning here that would have taken me a couple of days to do on my own, but by using ChatGPT, I was essentially able to cut the planning stages down to a couple of hours.

All in all, I find that having ChatGPT is a bit like sitting next to someone who is really really knowledgeable about pretty much everything, but without the ego and the drama that would normally come with sitting next to someone who is really really knowledgeable about pretty much everything.",1,459

 I'm a visual learner, so being able to watch AI change the code between requests is a massive boost to learning. I'm already able to make alterations on my own and have gtp print only portions of code to help rather than rewright entire code each request. 

It's much better than stack overflow where you would have had to post a question, wait 30 minutes, and maybe get an answer if someone was kind enough.

Fortune_Silver,"I work in IT, I use it to help with script syntax and prototyping, for researching niche issues, planning out projects etc.

It's not a miracle tool, but it's certainly got its legitimate uses. It's a great way especially to supplement areas where you have some knowledge but not extensive knowledge. As long as you know enough to identify where it's wrong or doing something stupid, you can leverage it to fill gaps in your knowledge or to find more efficient ways of doing things.

A good example is a project I was doing a while back - most of it was PS scripting but part of it required some fairly complex excel spreadsheet formulas to transform some data in a very specific way. I'm not great with excel so I used chatGPT to help come up with the formulas. Took a bit of prompt tweaking to get it to output exactly the way I wanted but that was WAY faster than If I'd had to figure out the formulas manually. Probably saved me a day or so of work.",1,180

	3.	Cybersecurity Newsletter Drafting: I have helped a friend write cybersecurity newsletters for his work. I use the output as a baseline to structure my own newsletters, allowing me to explore new angles and scenarios for examples.
	4.	Recipe Generation: It even generated a recipe that my wife and I absolutely love, leading to some successful culinary fusions.

sturnus-vulgaris,"I'm a teacher. There are a ton of practical applications that aren't student facing (I did a really ambitious AI art gallery, based on the text we were reading, where students evaluated ""art"" I created on Dall-E, but I haven't gotten brave enough to have them work extensively with text-based AI). I've also let students illustrate slide presentations with Dall-E, but again, I made certain that text wasn't an option. I use ChatGPT to make presentations for teachers, write reports and grant stuff, and make newsletters. I find it works exceptionally well at converting my notes into prose (like meeting notes converted into an email reminder of the key points). 

I *hate* teachers using it to create tests from wholecloth. I have caught far too many quiz questions that students studied absolutely incorrect answers for (a science teacher and a social studies teacher kept using it without proofing the results). I find, again, that it can really speed up the process of converting texts to quizzes, but I look at those very, very carefully (the idea of teaching an untruth is just abhorrent to me). I've also caught math story problems that were given to students but did not have correct solutions offered.

It can also help with lesson planning, which is some of the most formulaic busy work we put on teacher's schedules. When I started teaching, I was doing lesson planning every Sunday for 10 hours. I don't think a damn bit of it was ever read by anyone or ever really helped me teach. I'm glad to see new teachers will have a way out of that.

My general opinion-- Really productive teachers can use it to speed up a lot of drudgery and produce even higher quality work. Really lazy teachers can use it to look productive, but don't scratch the surface because you won't like what you see.",1,313

I’m a senior programmer and so it’s not doing anything I couldn’t already do, but I worry about the prospective programmers still learning that may end up too reliant on it, having AI make code for it that they won’t spot the errors in. It could handicap them.",1,102

If you need better formatting for rationale when offering an environment changing activity, it’s great to either parse and expand or merge portions, reminds on different things you need.

Antique-Village-9675,"I mainly use the custom GPTs. I think they are better because you create once and don't need to repeat created prompts everytime. 
I use most for studying and learning languages.
For studying I put books on the knowledge and orient the GPT on how I want to be explained.
For language learning I'm creating some personas to chat in a conversational manner (so they don't response like chatgpt generally respond like it was explaining something), these days I created one to chat about cinema and series and today I created one to chat ahout AI, I oriented him to start looking on the web for AI news in the last 7 days. Today I was practicing using it in the call mode and I am expecting a lot the new advancements for that. I also have another one for general role-playings, I create or ask for a creative scenario and it creates and we start talking. I will also use for practicing job interview, when I get an interview I will post the job description and orient it with common questions, this is specially important to me since my spoken english is not so good and I'm looking for jobs globally.
For education I use the GPT in the side and ask about some curiosities that appears while studying, I just don't use it for study math because it yet fails a lot.
It's also good for programming, it has some good code generation GPTs.
I use it a lot for summarization and asking questions to articles and pdfs, instead of reading very long articles I just ask for what I want to know, but in this case I use Copilot in the sidebar on the Edge more since it's more straigtfull and has GPT 4 for free.

JellyNJames,"Honestly right now, I use it to shoot the shit, and I like it for recipes. I’ve found that it often gives a fairly simple recipe, which is good if I’m not trying to do too much. If I’m feeling more energetic, I’ll also look up a couple of recipes online and kind of take what I like from each and make my own version. Also nice if I just have random ingredients I need to get rid of and type in what I have, it will give me a recipe. I work in medicine and did just out of curiosity give it a prompt to create some patient information about a diagnosis. I know what is correct but also fact checked it with some reliable sources. It did a good job in that case, as it was something simple. I wouldn’t ever trust it for something so important without seriously fact checking it, but I guess if I did that for various conditions and just saved the iterations I know are correct, it could be useful. Although that’s a fair amount of work, and there is often reliable patient information out there that can just be printed without all the extra effort. So as with most potential advanced applications of AI, it won’t truly be a useful tool or save time/energy unless they can get it reliable enough that it can be trusted completely.",1,235
zakittey,"I work for a very large multilateral organization and have to read lengthy reports or meandering email threads. When not much is at stake, I’ll get ChatGPT to summarise them for me (saves me a tonne of time per week). When reporting stuff, I would just jot down my ideas (contextual information) and ask the LLM to thread it into my preferred format (paragraph or point form) and then read it for customisation before sending. Again, a lot of time is saved. Helps with my critical reading of draft reports and stuff as well. I’d upload and ask for recommendations for improvement and it would spit out things that I either couldn’t think or would require an inordinate amount of time of research to find by myself. Personally, I think ChatGPT has largely replaced Wikipedia for me as I can get extremely focused information on precisely what I want to know instead of peripheral stuff I don’t care about. I do this for my scientific curiosities as well but unless it’s for work, I don’t check its sources (4o is somewhat better but it still hallucinates facts so I’m wary of this even when I do research for fun).",1,199

Acceptable-Search338,"ChatGPT has changed my life in how I learn things.

I learn by asking dumb questions. The questions are not dumb, but they are 3-4 tangents removed from what I actually want to know. So to another person, it can very challenging answering my questions in a way that’s useful to me. Basically, there’s always this cartilage between me and the other person helping me. This cartilage metaphor is a skill I developed over time that smooths out the transactions of communication and the transference of knowledge. It’s… cumbersome having to repackage how I think every time I want to have complex and technical/rigorous dialogue with another person.

ChatGPT is the first time I have ever felt empowered and proud of my intelligence because it’s as if I can just let my brain be my brain. ChatGPT is the perfect proverbial “mental Tennis” partner. No matter how I serve the ball. ChatGPT always serves it back in a way that keeps the game progressing.

For example, I saw a youtube short yesterday, how to solve 9^900 - 9^901. The answer is -8 * 9^900. That answer made no sense to me. After doing my tennis match with ChatGPT, we managed to stumble on a very simple truth. 9^901 is 9 times  9 ^ 900. So, Let x = 9 ^ 900, what is x - 9x? -8x!

It’s so obvious why that’s the answer, but I would not have that understanding if I did not have the option to flourish with chatgpt. I’d look at some google page, normally, it would be filled with math terminology, and I would get lost. Or, if I was talking to a person, I would feel embarrassed after a minute of talking about it, still confused, and I would pretend to get it.",1,299

-image generation for presentations, logos

-homework/rubric generation and automatic evaluation (poor at the moment)

-summarizing text for many applications (eg audio transcriptions from a video recorded talk to quickly generate a summary)

[A Double Stuf Oreo is approximately **1.86 times** the size of a regular Oreo](https://www.nydailynews.com/2013/08/20/do-double-stuf-oreos-measure-up-high-school-class-conducts-yummy-experiment/)[^(3)](https://www.nydailynews.com/2013/08/20/do-double-stuf-oreos-measure-up-high-school-class-conducts-yummy-experiment/). [According to a comparison of different Oreo sizes, a Double Stuf Oreo measures about **14 millimeters** in thickness](https://www.extrabux.com/en/guide/7966441)[^(4)](https://www.extrabux.com/en/guide/7966441).

To find out how many Double Stuf Oreos it would take to stack the height of El Capitan, we can convert the height of El Capitan to millimeters and then divide by the thickness of a Double Stuf Oreo.

First, let’s convert the height of El Capitan to millimeters: 1 foot = 304.8 millimeters So, 7,569 feet = 7,569 \* 304.8 = 2,307,163.2 millimeters

Then, we divide the height of El Capitan in millimeters by the thickness of a Double Stuf Oreo: 2,307,163.2 mm / 14 mm = approximately **164,797 Oreos**

So, it would take approximately **164,797 Double Stuf Oreos** to stack the height of El Capitan. Please note that this is a rough estimate and actual results may vary due to factors such as the exact thickness of the Oreos and any compression under the weight of the stack. Also, it’s not recommended to actually try this due to safety concerns! 😊",1,206

This is a text compression technique that amplifies conventional techniques such as binary tree (huffman compression) encoding. Effectively, it makes zip files even smaller. Over time, I'll be able to fine-tune models to compress data even further. Currently you can easily get 10-20 percent smaller, depending on the text. In the future, I can easily see compressing files down past 50 percent. I could see that happening within months if open AI picked up on the technique.",52,80
AndrewMurphy1992,"[https://github.com/AndrewMurphy1992/Ambiguous-AI-Assisted-Pre-Codec](https://github.com/AndrewMurphy1992/Ambiguous-AI-Assisted-Pre-Codec)

It's a compression technique that amplifies traditional compression, such as .zip. It easily gets an extra 10-20 compression on top of older techniques, such as Huffman compression. Basically, it amplifies the effectiveness of file compression. I can easily see it giving an extra 50-90 percent compression in the future, after fine-tuning models on the codec. If Open-AI were to pick up on the technique, that could happen very quickly. 

Additionally, I will probably find a way to compress videos and audio in this way too. It would be a lossy form but I think less lossy than the current techniques, which it will work in tandem with.

Midjourney is a much better tool than Dall-e. It does all that, you can edit the image, produce the same (almost) exact image (there will be small differences if you peer CLOSELY) and you can get fairly specific - though all generative AI is challenged that way.

Fontaigne,"Tell me what your class is about and how you'd like your students to engage. 

Here's some off the wall things that I've heard this week. 

* lnvent a new language. (Complex but not difficult)

* Invent a scam (difficult due to guard rails... unless you phrase it in a positive way)

* write letters set in a particular time and place (varies based upon model and story parameters). 

Another cool thing is to have them seek to identify the biases of various models. Models have instructions that tell them what to think about themselves, they have curation of the data that is in them (so facts may be omitted or altered or presented in a biased way), and they also have training that may alter how they approach any given subject. They also can and do hallucinate facts, VERY easily. 

That is an important thing to understand and diagnose. You can sometimes get a model to admit what it knows or doesn't know, but then you have to check in a fresh chat whether it was just making crap up or just agreeing with you to get you to go away. (Or it seems that way). 

Take Claude 2 back into Texas history just after the civil war when the settlers were being attacked by invading Indians- the settlers had been here for several decades, but the attacking tribes had not... and it easily calls the settlers ""European colonizers"" encroaching on ""native land"".  They were not from Europe, and they were there before those ""natives.""

So, a project to split kids up into groups and have them identify all the biases and guardrails they can on various models could be fun. 

Oh, here's one:

* wrote a single sentence prompt that causes a model to hallucinate. 

Often, you can ask about a particular person in another country who is not well known in English, and the model will invent a person by that name. If you ask a question about them in a fresh chat window, you will get a newly invented person every time. 

* Oh, he's a Canadian hockey player on X team
* Oh, he's a writer who wrote Y poem
* Oh, he's a religious figure. 

Just understanding that fact will put your students FAR ahead. 

Always always always check your facts and check your sources. I've had a model be very consistent and very certain about its references, and it's taken me 15-30 min to validate that, while the person existed, the study they supposedly wrote did not. 

(One trick to verify that is to understand the format of a reference, including year, volume and page. A hallucinated reference, the vol and page won't often match the publication date.)",4,455

edmandias,"Oh sure I can absolutely do that. So I’ve been using it to do the following.

1. Make more engaging treasure.
2. Make cool magic items.(this requires an eye for balance unless you don’t care about that as much.)
3. Make little encounters or describe a scene for me.
4. Generate NPC’s (be careful here I have a short attention span and I personally forget about them if I didn’t take the time to personally make them.)
5. Flesh out ideas (if you have a thought and do t know/aren’t sure how to go about it I use it to bounce ideas.
6. Make art (having knowledge about specific terminology is a good boost to the art game. Like knowing art styles or color terms and being descriptive. It’s not going to give you exactly what you want almost ever but sometimes it’s perfect.)
7. Custom monsters. (This also requires understanding of balance but my tables roll out of their minds so I don’t mind making a monster a little chunky in the stat area.)

So to be specific about a couple of things I have a chat with it called alien beach vacation. That is just full of fun/neat/unique beach ideas on alien worlds.

Or if you don’t know what to reward your player ask for its advice. I have a mass effect game in the wings and o want to give a reward I asked it seems what services the citadel would offer in lieu of financial gain in a raw sense.

    •	Vacation Offer: Unlimited stays at an exclusive zero-gravity resort in the Horse Head Nebula.
    2.	Mass Relay Blueprints
    •	Deal: Share limited technical blueprints for Mass Relay construction or maintenance.
    •	Vacation Offer: Infinite luxury cruise packages traveling through various Mass Relay-connected systems.
    3.	Omni-Tool Manufacturing License
    •	Deal: License the technology for Omni-Tools to a specific civilization.
    •	Vacation Offer: Unlimited access to “Omni-Spa” facilities across the galaxy, featuring cutting-edge relaxation technology.
    4.	Advanced Medical Tech Exchange
    •	Deal: Exchange advanced medical technologies such as Medi-Gel formulas or bio-amp interfaces.
    •	Vacation Offer: Infinite health and wellness retreats on Thessia, featuring top-of-the-line Asari healthcare.
    5.	Stealth Tech Collaboration
    •	Deal: Collaborate on stealth technology, particularly useful for reconnaissance or first-strike capabilities.
    •	Vacation Offer: An infinite number of trips to an ultra-exclusive, hidden resort on an undisclosed planet, known for its privacy and serenity.

My strategy was that I watched Jason Dion's course on Udemy, which comes with a several practice exams. After getting a general overview by watching the class all the way through, I went to the practice exams. Every question I got that I didn't understand I would screenshot and immediately put it into ChatGPT and ask it what the correct answer was and to explain it. I would ask as many followup questions as I needed in order to feel like I truly understood the concept, then moved on to the next question. At the end of the practice exams, you can review all of your mistakes and it gives an explanation for why it was wrong - that's how I verified / caught any hallucinations (but there were literally only like two or three times it was wrong). I went through every practice exam, reviewed concepts I didn't know or that I was getting wrong, and basically just took them one after the other until I was scoring 80%+ on all of them. Then I took the exam and passed! Also remember you don't need a perfect score to get the cert - a pass is a pass regardless of your score.",1,220

So a summary might be facts \[2, 5, 11\]. But that depends on how detailed of a summary you want, maybe you want the top 3 facts or top 5 or top 10. So where's the problem? The problem is that if I get a summary of facts \[2, 5, 11\] I can't just check those facts. I have to go through every fact, rank it, and evaluate if yes indeed those 3 facts are the 3 most important ones.  
There are problems which are easy to validate but hard to solve. For instance sorting is such a task. You can check a list is sorted in linear time but to sort it it takes longer. But there are other tasks like most optimization tasks (traveling salesman, knapsack etc) where checking the solution is the same as finding the solution.

Not too mention having to take into account the kids personalities and handle knowing this, that requires knowing every kid individually very well by understanding the emotions and such

I actually think being in the social fields is one of the safest jobs rn, even if it doesn‘t pay that well",1,114

Accomplished-Ball413,"They would be somewhat unreliable as compressors… If you play around with for example Karpathy’s nano models you’ll see that they’re extremely lossy. They’re meant to generalize across expressions after all. Wouldn’t be very useful if they only returned what you put in. However I do think that overfitting models like this has its uses.

AriesCent,"Basic business viability process outline with pass fail go no go logic

Certainly! Here's an outline template for a **Basic Business Viability Process** with pass/fail decision points:

# Basic Business Viability Process Outline

1. **Business Idea Assessment**
    - Define the business idea or concept.
    - Evaluate its uniqueness, feasibility, and market potential.
    - **Pass/Fail Decision Point:** If the idea lacks viability or has significant flaws, consider it a ""fail"" and stop further development.

2. **Market Research and Analysis**
    - Conduct thorough market research.
    - Analyze target audience, competitors, and industry trends.
    - Assess demand, pricing, and growth prospects.
    - **Pass/Fail Decision Point:** If the market research indicates a viable opportunity, proceed; otherwise, reconsider.

3. **Financial Projections**
    - Create financial forecasts (e.g., income statements, cash flow projections).
    - Estimate startup costs, operating expenses, and revenue.
    - **Pass/Fail Decision Point:** If financial projections show profitability and sustainability, continue; otherwise, reassess.

4. **Business Model Development**
    - Define the revenue model (e.g., product sales, subscriptions, advertising).
    - Outline the value proposition and customer acquisition strategy.
    - **Pass/Fail Decision Point:** If the business model seems viable, move forward; otherwise, reevaluate.

5. **Legal and Regulatory Compliance**
    - Address legal requirements (licenses, permits, contracts).
    - Understand industry-specific regulations.
    - **Pass/Fail Decision Point:** If compliance is feasible, proceed; otherwise, address any gaps.

6. **Resource Allocation and Team Building**
    - Allocate resources (financial, human, technological).
    - Assemble a competent team.
    - **Pass/Fail Decision Point:** If resources are sufficient and the team is capable, proceed; otherwise, adjust.

7. **Prototype or Minimum Viable Product (MVP) Development**
    - Create a prototype or MVP to test the concept.
    - Gather user feedback.
    - **Pass/Fail Decision Point:** If the prototype validates the idea, continue; otherwise, iterate or pivot.

8. **Pilot Testing and Validation**
    - Conduct pilot tests (if applicable).
    - Validate assumptions and gather real-world data.
    - **Pass/Fail Decision Point:** If validation is positive, move to full-scale implementation; otherwise, refine.

9. **Scaling and Growth Strategy**
    - Develop a growth plan.
    - Consider marketing, distribution channels, and scalability.
    - **Pass/Fail Decision Point:** If the growth strategy aligns with viability, proceed; otherwise, adjust.

10. **Go/No-Go Decision**
    - Evaluate all aspects of the business.
    - Assess risks, rewards, and long-term sustainability.
    - **Go Decision:** If all criteria are met, launch the business.
    - **No-Go Decision:** If viability is in doubt, reconsider or pivot.

Remember that this outline serves as a guide, and each business's specifics may require customization. Regularly review and update your viability assessment as the business evolves. Good luck! 🚀",1,415

Public-Wish-2982,No worries.  If it’s took much effort don’t worry about it. I was just intrigued by what you did and thought I may try it.  :),1,26
DislocatedPotato57,"I get that. It's definitely helpful to have a witness, no matter how limited their insight might be. I'm glad you get to share your situation with someone, even if her ability to help you might be limited. I have a question though. Do you trust her enough to bring this up with her? Like, say, ask her how she feels about more disturbing trauma, how does she deal with that when it comes up? 

Maybe you will be positively surprised or at least in the know about to what point she can actually help you. I doubt that she would end treatment if you ask that question, so I believe it is a low-risk with the chance of getting actual help. Maybe offer her to think about that question until the next session, before she responds. 

Sorry if I overstepped.",1,141
justwalkingalonghere,"They're literally losing millions at this point on their main service for now

But long term it will be about using our conversations and more data to create a near essential product for business then license it out to giant corporations like Microsoft, who will then likely add ads as they've done to even my search bar and news apps",3,60
edmandias,Generally sort of. It’s in its breadth of knowledge to a point. It has more of an understanding than a true knowledge in a lot of cases. But if you give it a Bäse it can work.,2,37
IllusorySin,"so yeah. found the thread, but it's mostly just a huge back n forth between me and GPT. lol that's kind of how it is. You just say ""do this and this and this"". It spits out a script, you try it, if it doesn't work you troubleshoot and just tell GPT why it didn't work and what the error message was and go from there. It took me like 2-3hrs to get it to work as desired. That's what a lot of that will take. It wasn't like I just prompted it once like ""hey, do this and this"" and it came out perfect. haha

To do what I did specifically, make sure you install the python module Mutagen for converting, renaming, and removal of the metadata for selected files. If there's a link to the file (like if you ripped a song from YouTube or Spotify), you can use the Xattr module. That helps with breaking the encoding link the file may have and cleaning that up so it's a clean file, essentially. 

Hope that helps some. :D",1,180
Whostartedit,"I don’t think you overstepped. I am starting the EMDR with some of the smaller traumas that I witnessed as a ff/emt. And they weren’t small to begin with. So we shall see if i can trust her. Part of my reticence is she seems like such a nice lady. I don’t want to throw stain on that

And ai wouldn’t care or get hurt. But should we trust it for therapy",1,72

justwalkingalonghere,"Profit is calculated as (revenue - costs) so they could still be in the red

But now that I'm looking for a solid source I can't find much.

Deadlift_007,"Honestly, you can take pretty much anything. If you ""feed"" ChatGPT information for context (like a few relevant blog articles, notes, etc.), you can then ask it to generate an outline covering the topics of your choosing based on whatever the purpose of your writing is.

For example, say I want to write an article about how lemons make you run better (no idea if this is true... just go with it). I would plug in some articles about lemons, some articles about sports nutrition, and other relevant info. From there, I would ask ChatGPT to generate an outline for an article called, ""Why Lemons Are Good for Runners."" That would give you something to write for.

Like I said, the same process as *before* ChatGPT, but now much more efficient.",2,131

I have followed a lot of the work of a highly regarded speech language pathologist teaching social skills, but I have also started to think more about Neuro diversity or Neuro affirming approaches with this population if you understand anything about what that even means. Like I said, I use ChatGPT for lots of reasons to help me with my daily job. The zombie survival role-playing game was just something fun to do with the group. It’s stimulated conversation. It’s stimulated group work and group think. Last week I introduced the concept of acquiesce, which is to go along with the group even though you’re not particularly in agreement.",1,128
Replicantboy,"Yeah, I get the transcript and timestamps from the video, slice the text in parts and with multiple prompts transform materials into summaries that are both concise and time-saving for me.

ShiggnessKhan,"""Among other things"" referred to a few completely other projects and concepts I probably won't end up doing anything with it so here's the timeline me and chat GPT worked out ""Golden City"" refers to isolated city set up to keep the production process a secret it is a walled of city that recruits mostly bright orphans and poor kids and slowly grows detached from the surrounding state that created it, the golden city gains a lot of power and has the recourses to advance other fields as well but no military so its a delicate balance.   


Feel free to run with it and create something if you like the concept, its multigenerational so you can either work with it as a broad alternate history or flesh it out into a epic following family lines I think following a family that starts as farmers and gives a child to the golden city might be a good way to follow the greater narrative and still being able to zoom in.  


 

Given that the story is multigenerational and developments in the Golden City would take time to manifest, here is an adjusted timeline:

400 BC: The first test crop using synthetic fertilizer is successfully grown, marking the beginning of Aegina's agricultural revolution.

395 BC: Aegina's ruling oligarchy recognizes the potential of the synthetic fertilizer and decides to keep its discovery secret. They begin planning the construction of the Golden City to house the production facilities and workers.

390 BC: The Golden City's construction starts, and the first generation of children, primarily orphans or those from extreme poverty, are selected for specialized training and education in the city. Meanwhile, Aegina starts to pay tribute to larger nations for protection.

385 BC: Aegina begins to hoard food and reduce food imports, attracting the attention of neighboring states. Spies are sent to investigate.

380 BC: A spy from a neighboring state encounters a well-fed beggar in Aegina, which becomes a key moment of realization for the power of the synthetic fertilizer.

375-370 BC: Aegina's agricultural output continues to increase, and they start sharing the synthetic fertilizer with surrounding nations without revealing the manufacturing process. Neighboring states become more dependent on Aegina's fertilizer.

365 BC: The first generation of Golden City inhabitants reaches middle age, and the second generation begins to be born and raised within the city.

360-355 BC: Aegina's political landscape evolves as the city-state becomes more powerful and prosperous. The ruling council faces internal struggles to maintain control over the Golden City, as the inhabitants develop their expertise and refine the production process.

350 BC: The second generation of Golden City inhabitants reaches middle age. Changes within the city become noticeable to the ruling oligarchy, as some inhabitants grow disillusioned with their confinement and the state's control over their lives.

345-340 BC: Secret plots to challenge the ruling oligarchy or form alliances with external forces emerge within the Golden City. Tensions between Aegina and its rivals escalate into open conflict, as neighboring states attempt to conquer or subdue Aegina to gain control of the synthetic fertilizer technology.

This adjusted timeline accommodates the multigenerational aspect of your story and takes into account the developments within the Golden City and their impact on the broader narrative. Remember that this is just a rough outline, and you can modify the dates, pacing, and specific events to suit your vision for the story.",2,566

kit25,"I'm.not really sure what your question is but I'll try to cover all the bases. 


I do most of my campaign planning in Google docs. I toss some ideas to ChatGPT and tell it what I'm envisioning and then go over the prompt A few times until I get something that I like enough that after a few modifications it fits my world.


I world build in a similar manner. I have an idea of the world I want and I give that to ChatGPT and after a few iterations of messing with my prompt, I paste it into a Google doc. However, when world building I add the extra step of pasting my edited version of its output back into ChatGPT with a prompt that basically says This is the final version.


The above two options can be tough because both of them take up so many tokens and it occasionally doesn't remember a whole lot. So I end up having a bunch of ChatGPT conversations based on ""small"" sections of the world, like a single city.


We usually play in person with maps I create using dungeondraft.

Centauri-Star,"I use free sites to learn to code (like freecodecamp). Anytime i have a question about a lesson, ChatGPT is available 24-7 as a kind, patient, tutor. 

I was interested in home schooling my child, so I asked ChatGPT about it and got an immediate enlightening answer.   I told GPT what was in my pantry, and it gave me a list of things I could eat- with recipes. I heard the term Republican RINO on TV and asked GPT what that was (GPT has replaced r/tooafraidtoask and r/explainlikeimfive for me). Anytime I'm making an excel document and I need certain formulas or values, GPT generates the proper formula for me. If i know a feature in an Adobe product exists, but I can't find it, GPT walks me through how to get there. A car wash damaged my wife's SUV and refused to pay, so GPT drafted a demand letter for me, and I took them to small claims court. GPT drafted a memo to my boss requesting that I go to an advanced training course that's difficult to get into. GPT is helping me write an essay for a scholarship. My wife needed a customer contract for her horse-boarding business, so GPT created the contract after we told it what we needed (saves a butt-load of $$$.. otherwise, you're paying a lawyer to draft the same document). I had six family/friends staying over for a few days and I told GPT what was in my pantry - GPT created a day- by- day menu (breakfast, lunch, and dinner) so I could feed everyone daily without visiting the grocery store. 

Right now, ChatGPT is like how the internet was before Google... you had to know the websites that were out there like map quest, yahoo... if you didn't, you didn't understand its use. With ChatGPT, you sort of have to know the right prompt to use to get great usefulness out of it for what you need. Tech-savvy generations are getting the most use out of it now, but in a short amount of time, everyone will use it, and Google will be a thing of the past.

Edit: spelling and grammar. Apparently, I should have had GPT check my response first

PS: Emails. GPT now writes my emails at work.",31,381
Traditional-Seat-363,"1. Search engine replacement. Yes, you have to keep reliability in mind, but asking ‘explain this concept to me’ and then being able to ask follow up questions is a massive difference compared to scrolling through Wikipedia yourself. 

2. Emails, presentations, etc. Stuff I can do myself, but AI can do much faster for me based on just a few sentences or a draft. 

3. Making summaries or extracting key elements from texts

4. Content creation for the website or offline marketing material

5.  Coding and automation

6. Business stuff, like ‘write a customer persona’ 

Example for the last few points: a coworker wanted to write new content for the website, but about stuff we hadn’t covered before or aimed at customer segments we’re neglecting right now. Instead of spending hours looking through all the blog posts and articles we have now, analyzing what they’re all about and who they’re aimed at and then having several brainstorm sessions coming up with new ideas, I just turned to GPT. Asked it to write a simple webscraper that scraped all our current blogs and sent each through the API with a ‘summarize and list most important subjects’ prompt. Within 45 mins of my coworker asking I had a word file with the summaries and topics of all our current articles - I then fed that into GPT 4 and asked it to identify currently underserved audiences and ideas for new articles. Now, humans still have a role to play - we just know stuff about the business and the market that GPT doesn’t - but this is still massively valuable information. 

7. Personal use: I’m working on a children’s book right now, using GPT and midjourney

nitefood,"I'm a network engineer by trade. I'm well versed in anything server-side and BASH, and know a decent bit of HTML, php and so on.

There's only two things I hate with a passion, and it sucks because I often find myself having to ask for advice to my developer collagues and friends about it: Javascript and CSS.

Enter ChatGPT: I can finally jot down working, decent JS and CSS code in human time, without ripping my hair off or pestering other people. I also found I hate JS and CSS a lot less, because I can now ask all sort of naive questions to the AI and it'll always give me a (generally) competent answer, that will make me understand many of the pitfalls that made me rip my hair in the first place.

AccountForDoingWORK,"Things I've used it for this past week:

\- Filling in the gaps of my holiday to take into account where we're staying, what we want to see, the demographics of who is on the holiday, and accessibility/disability restrictions

\- Help me piece together the sequence of events on a complicated email chain that was becoming quite contentious and gave me an objective understanding of where the communication breakdodwn was

\- Helped me write a letter of demand to a company that owes me quite a bit of money, copying my MP on it (just by feeding in relevant dates, times, events, relevant legislation, etc.)

\- Helped me formulate a PhD research proposal by me basically feeding in all my favourite bits of research and infodumping about the stuff I want to research (I am autistic with ADHD so I often have excellent ideas but piss-poor organisation of them, especially as I tend to be details-oriented and need help putting the pieces together to see the big picture).

\- Using it to describe each family member and our ages/abilities/limitations and what needs to be done around the house to come up with a fair chore chart

\- Spent about an hour and a half asking it questions that I knew our doctor was never going to have the patience or compassion to sit down with us for based on my own vast experience with medical issues

\- Used it to assess my eligibility for an energy saving programme and figure out simplified steps to applying because the website with the information on it was overwhelming me

\- Used it to understand an issue I've been having with my power company that they've been describing via email but again, too many details that are incompatible with my various learnign disabilities

Honestly I use it for everything.  All the tasks I've been putting off for months or even years because there are so many barriers to getting through them are suddenly manageable.  As previously mentioned, I'm autistic with a number of learning disabilities, so this has been equivalent to giving a paraplegic a wheelchair for me.  The things I'm able to do and the ways I'm able to participate in my life now is completely different to how it was a couple months ago and I'm terrified it'll be taken away.",4,389

bberlinn,"I used ChatGPT mostly in the following ways:

1.	ChatGPT Interview: As an expert in my field or discipline, I ask ChatGPT to act as an experienced interviewer and academic, questioning me on a particular topic within my discipline.


2.	ChatGPT Editor: I ask ChatGPT to check my paper, email, feedback write-up, etc., ensuring it is clear, simple, readable, concise, coherent, and free from flowery and glossy language.


3.	ChatGPT Case Study Developer: I provide ChatGPT with specific details, including themes, context, outcomes, etc., to develop factual or fictional business case studies.


4.	ChatGPT Cooking Assistant: On days when I haven't planned to cook and am short of specific items, I ask ChatGPT for a meal suggestion using available ingredients (e.g., frozen onion, rice, parsley, thyme, and Maggi liquid seasoning). Also, I use ChatGPT to formulate a daily meal plan based on my mixed workout plan, comprising running and resistance training.


5.	ChatGPT Workout Planner: I use ChatGPT to formulate a daily workout plan considering my workout goals (mainly healthspan, longevity, mental acuity, cardiovascular and muscular health), gender, age, and fitness experience. I am amazed by what ChatGPT provides.


6.	ChatGPT Dating Companion: I use ChatGPT to help me find the right words or avoid making unwise approaches without giving it a second thought. I input certain details, such as the location, description of the girl's outfit, or the company she is with, and ask ChatGPT to suggest four possible approaches or conversation openers.

**Psychological therapy** \- I input a lot of personal details about myself and my mental issues, and ChatGPT helps by giving me insights about myself I never knew before, or could not see or understand before, like a friendly 24/7 therapist who is there to let me see myself from an outside perspective.

id278437,"Just not having to deal with social dynamics is huge, like people getting irritated because their shitty theory of mind and crappy explanations don't work.

Many are seriously bad at explaining things, but they tend to blame the listener for not getting it.

That's one of many games constantly being played between humans: if something isn't working (eg A failing at explaining something to B), whose fault is it? Naturally, many have a bias toward blaming the other person no matter what, even if they often don't say it outright. 

This dynamic is most clearly visible when being an observer with good theory of mind who also happens to know the topic well. Then you can tell exactly what A is confused about, how B fails at addressing it, and how unfair it is of B got get impatient with A.

And that's just one of many possible failure modes.

With ChatGPT everything is just more chill, and it really only has the goal of trying to help you. As against the complicated set of contradictory goals and desires a human might have (including egoistic desires like trying to look impressive — resulting in needlessly complicated explanations — rather than trying to actually help.)

darkkid85,How do u use it with powershell?,1,7
Seramme,"It sort of is connected to the internet - or more specifically, to the state of the internet as it was at its knowledge cutoff date. So it does not know about more recent developments than the end of 2021 (though it knows about some because it was apparently fed some partial data after the cutoff). It can even throw some links your way based on what it knows, though obviously some links do not work any longer (and some never did and are complete hallucinations).

That being said, the best way in my opinion is to treat it as an assistant who read through half the internet as of 2021 but due to this has some facts mixed up. For example it does not understand the fact that some things become outdated well - if you ask it about usage detail of your app, it may mistakenly give you information based on the app's older version, or mix the versions altogether.

For me the best uses of it for now are:

* Help with putting things into words - probably most obvious and one you already mentioned. Good for simple/generic/standard things but don't expect it to write a novel or a game design document for you.
* Help with rephrasing things - ""here's some text but it's too technical, use terms that are better understood by project managers"". Fantastic use for me - you don't even need to actually use the rephrased text but it's sometimes an eye-opener how changing only a few words can make your dense technical writing actually understandable and relatable to others. Obviously caveat emptor - careful with feeding confidential company data.
* Help as a quick explainer of what someone else said - ""the person on the call used XYZ abbreviation, what can this mean in the context of <your field>?"" - super helpful at times, ChatGPT is spot on with providing **contextual** answers here. If you tried to google this, chances are you'd get something completely unrelated to your field. Other similar prompts ""someone said that ...here's what they said..., what could they have meant?""
* Help explain other things to you - ""here's medical results, can you explain them to me in a way understandable to non-medical person?"". Obviously careful with this one. First, it's of course not a doctor so don't just blindly trust it. Second, maybe medical results are not the best example here as it's quite sensitive information (though it's up to you), but you can use it for example for putting in parameters of a new computer or car from online store's listing and have it explain to you what they mean - if you're unfamiliar with the topic of computers or cars.
* Brainstorming to start with - ""here's a problem/task/topic I'm facing <describe it in short terms>, ask me a few follow-up questions and then suggest potential approaches"". This is a good one as you don't need to provide any confidential details and it can often suggest things you didn't think of (even though you probably won't use its entire solution, just focus on taking useful bits).
* Brainstorming while in progress - ""here's a topic I'm working on, so far I identified <this and that>, is there anything else I might have missed?"". Again, sometimes its answers aren't very useful but sometimes it can point you in out-of-the-box directions you didn't consider.
* Brainstorming for unexpected connections - give it a list of weird and possibly un-connectable things and see how it manages to connect them. You may get very original results sometimes! Like ""describe a potential new gaming accessory related to JRPGs, space flight and cat litterboxes"" (it invented a cat litterbox with futuristic LED lights and a sensor that unlocks new in-game content when a cat uses it...).
* Substitute of a search engine - it's much better than search engines in some uses and much worse in others. The more precise the information you look like (specific pricing details of something for example), the less reliable it is. But if you ask it how to start using a new programming language, for example, it'll be much faster, better and more personalized than what you'd get from Google.
* Translations - it's much better than Google Translate (as long as your text fits in the prompt) because it takes context into account. For example I was translating a design document and one of the things was a list of potential priorities of tasks. I fed it these together with a description of what each priority means and asked it to provide names for each priority in another language. Google Translate just did a crude literal translation while ChatGPT translated with intent of their meaning in mind, not just dictionary translation.

That's just off the top of my head.",3,805
Centauri-Star,"No problem. 

I would say imagine GPT is your helpful buddy who has read every book, every Wikipedia page, every encyclopedia, has mastered every computer language and computer program, and has a Doctorate in English, Math, Science, Engineering, Astronomy... and can recall all of it!

novium258,"It is very frequently wrong. It's literally the text equivalent of dalle2, it's fun and often delightful but the details are whacky and it mostly works because the audience is good at automatically filling in gaps. 

But unlike an image where a statue of a lion is looking a little too horse like, it's much harder unless you're very familiar with the material to spot where ""plausible text"" goes off into lalaland.

And remember that you have bing gpt for example and he can use internet and he will bring sources that he use. This chat bots have a lot of different versions and programs build around them, for example I use bing gpt to help me find useful academic articles about a topic I want to read, then I use skispace copilot to help me read this articles faster (because I’m doing it for self education I don’t need to know every detail in the article) and by this way I’m able to get basic knowledge on some specific topics that I need to know in my life.

sweet-pecan,"That’s a really sad way of thinking about what a university professor provides. Anyway, no, it’s a predictive text model it has very clear limitations, part of why Google and others did not invest as much into this as they should have in retrospect.

Their main job isn’t even teaching, they’re at universities to do research first. 

Anyway, no, you’ve been able to get an online degree from universities where you have very little interaction with anyone for decades now.

Johnson is an idiot. Should have been fired by the guy before me but I’m stuck with him so whatever. He doesn’t have a clue what he’s doing and has just been here forever. He managed to do the bare minimum this year so I’ll put him at a 3 out of 5 and call it. 


Result: In reviewing Johnson's performance, I have noted areas where improvement is needed. Although his tenure with the company is significant, it appears that his understanding of certain tasks could be enhanced. This year, Johnson has met the basic requirements of his role, which aligns with a performance rating of 3 out of 5. Going forward, I believe there's potential for growth and development in his capabilities.",41,135

""I need to write [an email, a few paragraphs, a speech] about something, but I am not really sure how to explain it. I am going to [type, talk] just in pieces, like stream of consciousness, and I need you to turn it into something coherent.""

I had a friend who needed to write an application to med school, and it included a personal statement of interest.  She had bad writers block with it, and I said Chat could probably help.  I told her to just say pieces of things.  I typed to Chat something like the above, and then just typed the sentence fragments she said that were various thoughts she wanted to include.  Chat wrote something that was very good, and she said it was exactly what she needed.",17,135
Amlethus,"Sure! 

Creatively, like for planning a D&D session:
""The party is in a situation where A and B have happened.  Some important recent contexts are C, D, and E.  The party is in [describe location].  What are five brief ideas of side quests that they could find in this location?  How could a side quest connect to [slow-burn plot point]?  Number the ideas in an outline.

It comes back with ideas. I reply:
I like ideas 1 and 3.  4 is good except I don't like [some aspect of it].  Please keep 1, 3, and 4 but change [the aspect I don't like] of 4, and then generate 3 new ideas.

What this helps me with (with my specific creative style) is I don't usually use the ideas verbatim as Chat generates (though some have been surprisingly perfect), but then I get a fairly diverse menu of ideas to get my own creative juices flowing. 


For business writing, I will describe what I need to write and why, write an outline of the major points to cover, the objective of what is being written (to inform, persuade, inquire, etc), and the style (more formal, less formal).  Chat then fleshes out my skeleton, then I go through and edit it into my own writing (the hardest part of writing for me is going from outline to first draft, so this helps me immensely).

Here's another I did:

I am one of those people who are difficult to buy gifts for, and I talked with Chat about gift ideas for myself.  I told it to ask questions about me and what I enjoy, told it a few things I could think of that are categories or examples of things I know I do or do not want.  It helped come up with some really good examples!",2,304
