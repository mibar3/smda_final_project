It came back with 8-10 things, one of the things it stated was clearing a path for paramedics. So myself and others moved all the lunch tables to the outskirts of the room. When EMT came they were able to easily maneuver and get the person to the hospital. Again, since others were attending the individual I had time to do this. I thought it was very helpful.",838

Ghazzz,"I am a software developer. 

I have it respond to stuff I want to bring up with my team, to be better prepared for meetings. (""respond three times, once as project lead, once as an educated user, once as a malicious user""). I also like to give it proposed ideas and find pros/cons. It is also very useful in the initial phases of development, to more easily find where to focus attention. To be clear, I am not presenting as if these were my ideas, I am just the ""AI-whisperer"" in the group. There is an internal policy of not giving it actual code or detailed product descriptions.

It has also replaced most information-gathering web searches in my personal life, and this is where I have been playing around more.

Unsure what to make for dinner? Just ask for recepies including ""these things"", or ""what is left after I made the dinners this week"" when it starts having that granular information. Ask for new staple ingredients that I might like based on earlier feedback, generally it works great as a kitchen buddy. I even ask it if I have enough of some ingredient while at the store. ""Have to save money this week"" vs. ""This is an important dinner date"". ChatGPT knows what shelves different foods are stored on, and the best before dates on the dry goods. This is my ""complete information"" test, and it is working very well. It has made me eat better.

Other non-professional areas I have discussed are; leather shoe maintenance, fashion tips, beard grooming, house maintenance, renovation queries and organisation. These kinds of queries were iffy back in December, I expect the dataset had a lot of sponsored content, but it has gotten better since.

As for education, I have been trying to wrap my head around the magnetism/electrics end of physics, getting feedback on written texts and done lots of ethics discussion, to freshen up my Ex.Phil. and ethical computing courses. In an education/professional capacity I have also had it do two-paragraph summaries of algorithms and concepts that I have forgotten or never encountered before, this has saved me at least a week of work-related research this year.

PrestigiousMood6511,"When I started my position in 2019, I created a 'helper' spreadsheet for myself that I called my Assistant.  

Over the next couple of years, with the help of Google, I was able to hack together some queries and VBA that made my job much easier.  I named it Assistant2 and shared it with my boss and team. It was buggy and still pretty tailored to me so literally nobody used it.  

I spent the next year fine tuning it, working out most the bugs, adding a lot more code, and made it more versatile for other positions in our company.  After a period of hesitation, I sent Assistan3 to my boss and coworkers again.  This time, it was picked up by a couple people on the team and eventually passed around to a handful of others.  Success in my book! 

Then ChatGPT came out.

In less than 3 months, I ran every line of code I wrote through ChatGPT with 1 simple instruction:  ""Look at the code below, is there a more efficient way to get the same result?""  If I didn't understand the output, I would ask it to explain the code to me one line at a time.  If the code gave me errors, I would ask ChatGPT to fix it.  

Let me tell you, in the past 5 months I've learned more about SQL & VBA than I have in the past 5 years prior. Not only has it produced a polished product, but Assistant4 has been picked up by the majority of our C-suite which has been passed down to their employees!",17

FascinatingGarden,"There was a particular cookie my grandmother used to give me and I really liked the taste and texture, and I had looked at the grocery to no avail until one evening (at the store) I decided that it might be fruitful to ask ChatGPT for help.  By patiently interrogating ChatGPT and iteratively closing in on it through various descriptions, I discovered that it was SnackWell's.

I recently asked it a softball question about a certain UPDATE command in SQL.  Not super hard but I decided to use ChatGPT rather than sifting through search results (which also would have worked).  It did very well.

I've asked it legal questions about taxes and property rights and it seems pretty good at that.  Legal language, in an attempt to be reliable, has had to contort into some forms which can feel unnatural to those of us unaccustomed to it, but it can be fairly logical and consistent, and ChatGPT can parse that well and then translate it into forms which we can understand more easily.  It can also tirelessly rephrase and digest things for you, even providing examples for a concept.  I find this really useful.

In every interaction, watch out for occasional false positives.  If you're asking anything important, try to fact-check ChatGPT's answers.  Sometimes if you give it the Third Degree it will apologize and correct itself and provide additional useful information.",7

An example is, I have ADHD, and I sometimes get super distracted if I remember a scene in a TV show but can’t remember what show. You can feed it details of the scene and it can tell you exactly what episode of a series it’s from. (Also works for movies)

nestedbrackets,"I'm regularly looking into health and fitness information, often trying to get specific answers that are based on scientific studies. Both ChatGPT and Bard are great for this, they can traverse hundreds of studies and I can get rather picky about what information I want, continually building on the context.

Brief example of questions from ChatGPT: (omitting answers for brevity)  
\- What are the benefits and side effects of taking L-arginine?  
\- Does citrulline have similar effects?   
\- What risks are there in taking citrulline?   
\- Those sound like mostly short term risks. Are there any long term risks?   
\- Are there any studies related to the first two risks?   
\- Can a person get the benefits of citrulline with less than 8g per day?

Brief example from Bard (hope that's OK here):  
\- Do deadlifts release growth hormone in the body?  
\- Did any studies use only one set?  
\- Did any of the one set studies take the set to failure?

I could have gotten all this information myself, but it probably would have taken hours of parsing large studies and looking for specific dosages and subject parameters. The new AI systems make this a breeze.",5

Aglavra,"(my native language is Russian, I'm a language tutor,  translator and a copywriter)

 Creating exercises for my students to practice various grammar and vocabulary topics (""Create a fill in the blanc exercise to practice past simple and present perfect in contrast, on the topic ""summer holidays"", make 10 sentences, do not show answers""). Works pretty well, although requires corrections sometimes.


Explaining words. ""In the phrase ""..."", what does the word/phrase ""..."" mean?"". It understands context well, so it is much more useful than just looking up in the dictionary. It can also explain idioms and references. (Currently, i prefer Bing for this task, as having links to sources is important)


When I write in English, reviewing and correcting grammar, improving style. Finding synonyms to make the text sound more unique. Especially useful, when I need to write 100% unique text on the topic that was already discussed thousand times.


Via poe.com, I've created two bots for my students. One   makes ru-en and en-ru translations of word and phrases, commenting on the sentence structure (what does each part of a sentence mean and why this or that form is used) and giving simple examples for translated words.(when using existing online dictionaries, middle-schoolers often get overwhelmed with tons of examples and meanings they don't need right now). The second one is a conversation partner for language learners. It supports conversation on various topics, while giving feedback on mistakes in the student's input. Again, it is important that the feedback is given in the student's native language.


Random questions. When something like ""Why exactly do dogs enjoy fetching sticks?"" or ""Is it true that cemeteries are always colder?"" pops up in my head, I now have a place to get a quick answer.

[deleted],"It helped me become a billionaire. 

Becoming a billionaire is not an easy feat and often requires a combination of talent, hard work, perseverance, and sometimes even luck. While there's no guaranteed formula for becoming a billionaire, here are some general steps you can follow to increase your chances:

1. Develop a clear vision: Determine your goals and the path you want to take to achieve them. This vision should be ambitious, but also realistic and aligned with your passions and strengths.

2. Educate yourself: Gain knowledge and develop skills in your chosen field. This may include formal education, online courses, or self-directed learning. Stay informed about industry trends and innovations.

3. Build a strong network: Develop relationships with professionals in your field, as well as mentors who can provide guidance and support. A strong network can help you access resources, opportunities, and valuable advice.

4. Identify opportunities: Look for gaps in the market or areas where you can innovate or disrupt existing industries. Be open to new ideas and willing to take calculated risks.

5. Start a business or invest: Many billionaires have built their wealth by starting or investing in successful businesses. Focus on creating a scalable, high-growth business that has the potential to generate significant wealth.

6. Be persistent and adaptable: Building wealth often takes time, and you may encounter setbacks or failures along the way. Stay persistent, learn from your mistakes, and adapt your strategies as needed.

7. Practice financial discipline: Manage your finances wisely, reinvesting profits to grow your business or investments. Avoid excessive debt and maintain a long-term perspective on wealth accumulation.

8. Diversify your investments: To mitigate risk, invest in different industries or asset classes. This can help protect your wealth from fluctuations in individual markets.

9. Leverage your success: As you achieve success, use your influence and resources to create additional opportunities, forge partnerships, or expand your business.

10. Stay focused on your goals: Becoming a billionaire requires dedication and hard work. Maintain your motivation by staying focused on your goals and surrounding yourself with supportive, like-minded individuals.

Remember that the pursuit of wealth should not come at the expense of your personal values, ethics, or the well-being of others. Strive to create a positive impact through your actions and use your wealth to contribute to the greater good.",2

Cheating might work for school kids but not so well for home educated kids. 

...told my husband to debate his political passions with it so he wouldn't spend so much time expounding on his ideas for me when I'm busy, I've informed him it's a public service as many of the online things are essentially text products.

... asked i to explain why X is Y as a good starter

Life is looking up but I have a hard time reconnecting with people, I'm anxiety ridden when trying to initiate contact and often just stare at my text for a long time and play out all the worst scenarios then never send it.

ChatGPT encouraged me to just honestly communicate, to try to reconnect. So I ended up just doing it after a long talk to chatGPT. What helped most was it's affirmations when doubt and negative emotions set in after writing. Stuff like ""Remember, you took the initiative to reach out, and that's commendable. It's important to be patient and not jump to negative conclusions."" which probably sounds normal to everyone reading this, but I needed to hear that.

I now go to the playground once or twice a week with my niece and nephew and have been invited over a couple times to fun family outings.

I wouldn't have done any of that without encouragement and I'm super happy chatGPT was there to bounce my thoughts off of.

Life is getting back on track.

It's also great at encouraging in general when I feel stuck working on my video game for example. It's coding advice is rather unimpressive in general but it can help me find the right solution just by thinking through the problem and bouncing it off someone.

mikerodbest,"I develop prompts that turn GPT into different kinds of highly attenuated writing assistant AI bots.

My prompts are not yet available publicly but I've discovered some very unique ways to get an AI Bot to become different kinds of assistants. One of my most important achievements in prompt engineering is creating a bot that asks the user specific questions in a sequential order to understand precisely what the user desires. After the bot has all of the information it needs then it compiles a complete work for you.


Examples:


- Character Creator
The bot asks you for your vision of a character and then provides a full character with 9 different attributes, asking you if you want to change any part of it afterwards. This is for people developing stories for any medium. Whether novels, comics, television, movies. The response is professional, elaborate and highly detailed.


- Synopsis Creator
This bot asks you a series of questions 1 by 1 about your story idea and with any question it asks then you can ask it to come up with something for you or to help you with a few ideas. After you have told the bot you are satisfied with the answer to the current step question then it moves on to the next question. One of the questions is about the characters, it is possible to place either the summary or the entire character profile from character creator into synopsis creator. By the end of the question session you are given a complete synopsis for a storyline that is professional, elaborate, and detailed. You may also use the same bot to generate the story outline and I am considering adding to the prompt for specific outline formation.


- Storyteller
Using your synopsis and sections of your outline, begin to create first drafts of your stories in either screenplay, novel, or narration format.


- Refined Storyteller
Using character profiles and story drafts use this bot to expand upon sections of your screenplay, novel, or narration drafts.


- Gonzo Journalist 
Create in depth media articles using SEO from scratch. Write a style guide, outline, draft, and expand upon draft sections. Increase or decrease engaging gonzo style content. Always be scientifically factual, as well as credible. Change the world through solutions focused media that helps people understand problems and then learn to mitigate them. Motivate the masses and inspire change.


- Taoist Monk
Gain wisdom from the tao and be told by an AI monk original mind boggling koans, insightful metaphors and similes, and snippets of wisdom from ancient taoist texts. This AI taoist is designed to generate its own intriguing content but simply based on taoist culture. It speaks like a person instead of like an AI. You won't be able to tell the difference between whether this is actually ancient text or whether this is a brand new understanding of an old an honorable way of life.


- Therapist (coming soon)
Asking very specific questions in a sequential order, and empathizing with the client, this is a true therapy session which results in the therapist recommending a type of therapy and route to improvement to you. Then you can explore that route of therapy together as this AI uses the knowledge of certain therapy types available to humanity on the Internet. These responses are not at all robotic.",2
ChampionshipComplex,"Lol what is wrong with you! Are you from the past?

It is astonishing how little people's imaginations run too with ChatGPT - I'm fed up with technically challenged TV presenters asking it mundane questions like 'Hello how are you' and 'What can you do', and YOUR question is like someone looking at the invention of writing, and not understanding how it can be used for anything other than a holiday itinerary.

Searching the Internet which we've all got used to, is normally us wanting to know something and finding out the answers so that we can solve the problem. 

With ChatGPT you don't search for the answer, you tell it the problem and it produces the solution. 
If you don't know how to describe the problem you can even tell it to ask you the questions to help it understand the problem sufficiently to then solve the problem. 

That means you can say things like 'be a doctor and ask me a series of questions about my current medication and health and then diagnose any symptoms and make suggestions on how to improve my overall health'. 

You could say 'I run a company that designs web pages, ask me some questions about my business and my customers and then suggest some compelling logos, a cool slogan and produce a multi year business plan to grow the business to 50 percent.'

You can say 'Interview me for a job in sales, ask me as many questions as you need to ascertain my strengths and weaknesses in those areas, give me a review and then recommend some ways in which I can improve'. 

I and my colleagues at work use it constantly - at work it will answer any technical questions and we can give it error logs and it tells us what do do. It produces policy documents, news posts, does job descriptions, interview questions and reviews candidates resumes. 

At home I record music, and I ask it for chords, lyrics. My drummer last night knew a song was in a particular tempo and that it went into a triplet part in the middle eight and we just asked ChatGPT what the triplet tempo would be so we could program it into our recording software. 

For fun my son uses it to make up questions for him, such as 20 multiple choice Pokemon quizes when we're in the car. 

I've had it write programs for me, it's clarified legal terms for me, it's helped me work out the best products to use, it's solved maths problems, I've used for family history research, to track down problems with the car, to simplify complex text, to improve the readability of some of my own documents, to write poetry, to compare products, to look up government legislation, to present recipes, to design web pages, to find particular songs that I can only remember the lyrics to, to track down movie information, to look up patents, to look up bird species etc. 

I'm not sure what it can't do.",-1

I find it much more straight forward than Googling things, and I can discuss subjects with it that friends and colleagues either can't or are unwilling— AKA ""boring"" subjects. If the ChatGPT responses are too surface, I can ask for more detail (usually specified) and it will go much deeper. Sometimes I just like to ask it about itself; data sources, ability to extrapolate from users input, ability to match tone and language syntax of user... When I ask for more specific details on a subject, I find that future responses to those types of questions are more highly detailed from the start. It told me that it does not retain information about past conversations, but I can ask if it remembers a previous conversation (a week or more prior) on a particular subject, and it will say ""Yes, of course"" and give me a summary of it.",1

Longjumping_Seat_306,"Disclaimer, I couldn't articulate as well as ChatGPT could so it wrote this for me...

Since the release of ChatGPT in December 2022, I have leveraged AI to significantly enhance my skills and productivity across various domains. Although I was already an expert in VBA, ChatGPT has expedited my workflow, including writing quick and dirty macros for automating admin tasks to complex logic in DAX for Power Query, which 10x my productivity at work as a data analyst.

Initially having zero knowledge of Python or Rust, I now push the boundaries of Python and employ Rust for more demanding tasks, with ChatGPT writing all the necessary code. ChatGPT has been instrumental in helping me build Python applications, develop trading bots, web scraping bots, and master the use of APIs, discovering new python libraries for completing or automating tasks.

My programming journey includes setting up servers for deploying trading bots, configuring Ubuntu through bash commands, installing remote desktop environments, and utilizing the Flask library to stream data over the internet. I've also learned to encrypt data and manage environment variables.

When ChatGPT first launched, it guided me through building a WordPress site and using MidJourney to generate images for sale. Although the venture wasn't financially successful, it provided valuable experience in product creation and sales.

My focus has since shifted to programming, specifically building and backtesting trading bots and implementing strategies. I've also explored using AI APIs to send queries via Python to large language models and running Hugging Face LLMs locally.

This is me writing now... My next possible venture, I'm thinking of how to employ AI in to large blue chip corporations who for the most part are still very skeptical about AI and are keeping it at arms length. Including the large corporation I work for.   
  
My thinking is that these companies have alot more hurdles to go through then your average consumer, hurdles which include data privacy, GDPR, sensitive data leaks. These companies are unlikely to send customer data to companies like open AI over the cloud, but seeing as chat GPT has taught me how to run and train my own language models I can potentially offer a solution for a company to run their own AI language model on their own machines or server thus and training their AI model on their proprietary business practicesses, all of their SOPS, all of their training material.

This can potentially replace the majority of customer support staff, they could use AI to train new starters reducing the need for training staff. If anybody is driven and ambitious and lives in the UK and has an entrpeneurial mindset I'd be happy to share ideas back and forth on how to go about offering this as a business solution.

I'll let ChatGpt finish it off...

In summary, ChatGPT has been a transformative tool in my journey, guiding me from a proficient programmer to someone capable of handling complex projects and continuously pushing the limits of my technical abilities.",1

GPT: Here are a few potential causes for these readings:...



Q: Could a panic attack cause this?



GPT: Yes, a panic attack can cause...



Q: What if the palms are sweaty?



GPT: Sweaty palms, also known as palmar hyperhidrosis, can indeed be a symptom of a panic attack.



Q: ...and the knees are weak?



GPT: Weak knees can be another symptom associated with panic attacks and anxiety. During a panic attack, the body's ""fight or flight...""



Q: ...and the arms are heavy?



GPT: Heavy arms, along with sweaty palms and weak knees, can also be symptoms associated with anxiety and panic attacks



Q: ...and there's vomit on his sweater already...mom's spaghetti?



GPT: It sounds like you're referencing the famous lyrics from Eminem's song ""Lose Yourself."" In the context of the song, these symptoms are metaphorical, describing the intense pressure and anxiety the protagonist feels before performing.



Q: No, those are just more symptoms. How can I get vomit spaghetti out of my sweater?

dcphaedrus,"I’ve found it to be very useful for 
1. Programming. Especially improving iteratively upon existing code. Or explaining what certain sections of code do. 
2. Cutting through parts of Google that have become mired in SEO-optimized sites with tons of ads. For example, when I want to cook something I don’t usually cook, I ask GPT to give me a quick X recipe. Normally recipe sites are designed with a ton of ads and force you to scroll forever just to find the ingredient list and instructions. All the top recipe hits on Google results are designed this way because they’ve been catering to a world where people Google everything. Now it’s so much easier. ChatGPT, tell give me a quick recipe for a fried chicken sandwich. Chicken tagine. Cardamom blondies. Anything really, it just gives you a list of ingredients and steps you need to do. No scrolling. No ads. Expand this from cooking to most things you would normally Google for instructions. 
3. Summarizing complicated things into layman’s terms. For example, reading a patent application and telling me in more basic terminology what something does.

lavransson,"1. Obscure software coding quandaries
2. Get me answers from sprawling tech documentation
3. Wordsmithing a mess of thoughts into something readable

As for #1, I've used chatGPT when I have obscure software code and syntax questions that I don't really care to figure out. Before chatGPT, I googled like every other programmer, and often wind up on multiple Stack Overflow pages. Hit or miss. Eventually I figure it out. 

What's nice about chatGPT is that is usually gets it right and I don't have to sift though innumerable webpages and dead ends to find the answer. I've heard chatGPT described as ""Google on steroids"" and this is correct. ChatGPT does in seconds or minutes what would take me many more frustrating minutes to do myself, sifting though Google's garbage result to find what I need. The [enshitification of Google](https://pluralistic.net/2023/01/21/potemkin-ai/#hey-guys) over the past few years (crappy search results that increasingly aren't what you want or need) makes chatGPT even more helpful.

For #2, the other day I needed to figure out how my software app could integrate with some Microsoft Azure functionality. At first, I was reading through MS's tech doc, which is actually pretty good. But it's also sprawling and disconnected and trying to figure it out is exhausting. So I asked chatGPT and it spat out exactly what I needed. Keep in mind that I had a general idea of what I wanted, I didn't ask a basic question.

For #3, I enjoy writing and I think I'm a decent writer. But sometimes I am just tired and don't have the energy to write, or I just don't care enough to put in the effort. I can word dumb a lot of stuff and chatGPT cleans it up. So I outsource it to chatGPT and it does a pretty good job of writing what I need. I'm talking about business writing here, not personal or ""fun"" writing.",1

I've switched over to Bing for more in depth research when it comes to writing research and software solution research. I get more prompts, and the ability for it to find more upto date information is important - especially with software but also with the writing help since I need to look into a lot of material science and engineering advancements because it's a hard sci-fi setting.

Lately I've been using Bing first for most stuff then moving that info into chatgpt or the playground when I'm fully repaired and ready to use those valuable 20 messages every 3 hour (so stupid) or spend money.",1

And writing: I feed it very detailed character descriptions and the story context and ask it to write specific scenes. It's nice cause then it does give me an idea of what my ideas could look like without me having to actually write it (cause my writing is still kinda shitty). And because chatgpts writing style is kinda good, it really is encouraging me to continue with the story. And it also helps me cause usually you have these character sheets with questions, but I just never remember it and find it hard to actually implement it, and chatgpt just knows it from the description I gave, it writes the scenes I want, and those scenes make the characters feel much more real, which makes it much easier for me to get a feel for them.

Impressive-Ad6400,"I'm using it to write short stories for my daugther. She's on the spectrum, so she becomes a bit obsessive about certain stuff like ""What where the parents of Shrek doing when they were kids?"", so we try to write the question with enough information so ChatGPT figures out what to write. 

I use it at work to write reports. Sometimes, for privacy reasons, all the information you can give about a patient is just a couple of lines (""her husband died, and now she's depressed"") but insurance demands you to fill paragraphs with the same information, over and over. So I can ask ChatGPT to expand on that information, saying  the same thing with different words and save time in the process. 

My eldest daughter uses ChatGPT to understand topics in her classes when her teacher is too  obscure with his lessons. GPT is eager to explain complex topics in a clearer way.

Emails: Whenever I need to send a serious email out, I use chatGPT, which cuts my analysis paralysis when it comes to wording and sentence structure down by 95% and often covers things or phrasing I don't know if I would have thought of otherwise.

Data entry: I know there are better ways but as of right now, I feed handwritten stuff for OCR into AWS, download the raw text, then have GPT phrase it out. Cuts my time down by 50% and I don't have to deal with the very taxing process of manual entry.

How do I do X?: I was asked how to do a dropbox in sheets, scan in color, and why an employees email was going to spam this week. Stuff I can figure out but nothing I knew off the top of my head. I got answers in about 5 mins to each of those using either chatGPT or bard.",1

I start by explaining the purpose of the prompt and it's context, provide GPT with the prompt, then provide whatever text I want evaluated. I never tell GPT that the text is my own or whomever's for the sheer possibility it presents user bias. Typically it finds my reasoning consistently sound, every now and then we get into discussions if I feel it needs further context, but once it absolutely shredded a point I was trying to make to the point I swapped out the topic of that paragraph with a different one that it evaluated as more fitting - thankfully that swap was already one I had on backup so I didn't feel like it provided me the angle.",1

TC_exe,"I'm working on a game in Game Maker Studio. Originally I tried asking ChatGPT to write entire functions for me, but I ran into too many issues, like it making major assumptions about my code, or using things in the wrong places. Instead, I just ask it questions that I used to google, it's great for quickly clarifying what things do or how to use things. I.e. I knew irandom() gives me a random number, but had a feeling it was only for integers, so I asked and it clarified that if I wanted decimals, I needed random() instead. Basically saves me heaps of time sifting through forum posts and tutorials.

I also use it regularly for reminding me of things, occasionally I remember a scene from a movie but can't recall where it was from, so I type out what I remember and 9/10 it tells me the movie from my vague description.

I've also used it for guidance on how to start projects if I really don't know where to begin, it'll basically give me a to-do list, and I can ask for clarification wherever I need it. This really helps to skip the first few hours of something I'm unfamiliar with.

mattspire,"I’ve been using it as a writing partner for my creative writing. I don’t have it do any actual writing, but bounce ideas off of it, use it to find connections between elements I’ve missed, and speed up brainstorming. The last point is arguably the most important and useful. When doing anything creative, you come up with the most obvious solutions first. Asking an LLM for 20 ideas helps you get them out of the way FAST, and some of the ideas aren’t bad, either. Depending on the complexity of the issue, that could potentially save hours.

And the research side… half the time I’d not even know *how* to research with Google. Now I can ask GPT a question like, “I want my character to sustain an injury from using a gun. They have never used a gun before, and picked up an old shotgun in self-defense. What are some likely mechanical problems that would lead to a non-lethal but debilitating injury in this scenario?” Like, I don’t know shit about guns, I don’t really care about guns, none of the research I could conceivably do really matters to the plot and even the plot point itself only serves to ratchet up tension—and yet not even knowing offhand how to find answers with a conventional search engine, I could spend an hour on this, easily, and totally get out of the writing “zone.” GPT will give me 5 answers in seconds.

Usually it confirms my assessment but sometimes it rates differently which prompts me to re-read the assignment to see, sometimes I agree with the new assessment by the AI, other times I disagree, but it is helpful to bounce off of when a human cannot be found.

It is surprisingly still slightly slower to feed criteria and texts into the AI than just reading and grading myself though.

I never get ""stuck"" any more. Any time I'm writing a message or email and it's taking longer than 5 minutes I just put a summary into chatgpt and it crafts a professional response that usually says everything I need to say.

It writes all my business social media posts. I also use dal-e for funny images to go along with the text. It also writes replies to feedback and reviews when I can't think of another way to say ""thanks for the lovely review!"".

It has helped me craft an seo plan for my website that is actually helpful and achievable. Fingers crossed its effective too! It appears to be pretty good at advising on seo and chatgpt4 is good at generating suggestions beyond the obvious ""create content"" type stuff.

It is not very good at writing product descriptions as they come out very repetitive, but given appropriate guidelines it can change a description to be for a different product - useful for me where I have multiple similar things for sale and need the descriptions of each to different enough that google doesn't declare it a duplicate.


I'm currently working through learning how to automate various repetitive tasks in my business, and chatgpt has been pretty useful here too. I tell it what I want to do and it is usually able to advise on how to do it. Sometimes it gets things wrong but so far it's mostly good.


For me, it's most useful for situations where I want to emulate what the bigger companies are doing. For situations where I need to do something new and different it's less helpful, but it is a fantastic time saver for just about everything else .",1

My birth mom is romanian, in my twenties I found her and there has always been a language barrier, especially since she is uneducated and her grammar is awful, any other online translator just does not work.. now with chatGPT I can translate what she's saying reliably. I have it give me an exact translation followed by two interpretations. being able to suddenly talk to my real mom is surreal.

I have a word document on my desktop filled with instructions that I copy paste to chatGPT.

If i come across a problem in a video game, asking chatGPT is the fastest way to get an answer. 

My dog got skunked recently and chatGPT told me which household products to use.

Its great for cooking recipes. if you only have specific ingredients itll make a recipe for you. Gone are the days of googling a recipe and having to subtract or substitute ingredients.

You can ask chatGPT for passages or quotations from old roman historians or any author and site the translation version. Majority of my time on chatGPT is going down history rabbit holes.

Word games. I made up a word game where the objective is to defeat what the other person says. for example I say ""fire"" you would probably say ""water"" and then id say ""freezing temperature"". you can mention any know thing in the universe like people, places, ideas, philosophy, fictional ideas or time travel but cant repeat the same thing twice.

mikumuso,"I use chatbotGPT for a lot of different things.

Academic:

I'll ask it technical questions about Sanskrit scriptures and book suggestions for vedic studies and it will make some pretty good suggestions. It will give me a list of authors and books I can read. It also explains technical terms, and I can check the sanskrit dictionary to confirm it's not making things up.

Meal Planning and Nutrition:

I will ask it for nutritional food related ideas and to divide quantities of recipes I've found online into half, 3rds or for one person. This is incredibly useful and helpful. It also comes up with ideas based on my prompts like ""come up with an Italian fusion sushi"" or ""come up with a michelin star Japanese fusion pasta recipe"" and it will do that. Other things I might ask it might include ""Write me a recipe for pho infused shao long bao"", ""write me a recipe for lasagne with bechamel, featuring the fruit durian, and laksa spices of galangal, lemongrass, palm sugar, fresh turmeric, chilli, and coconut cream for the sauce"".

Nutrition wise I will ask it for anti-inflammatory foods, then I will ask it to list the active ingredient, and explain the pharmacology and pharmakokinetics, I can then look it up on wikipedia for basic wikipedia quality content, and then watch a youtube video or read a book for further information.

Medical:

I've asked it for medical advice and it is surprisingly impressive.

Budgeting:

I've asked it about grocery prices and it gets things surprisingly accurate. I also have asked how to calculate my petrol price, fuel intake, cost of a roundtrip. This is extremely helpful for budgeting.

Dream Interpretation:I use the plugin Dream Interpreter (I think that's what it's called), it really understands dreams. Its quite impressive.

Creative Script Writing:

I ask it things like ""Write a movie script that combines Doctor Strange, The Matrix, and Inception featuring Doctor Strange, Neo from the Matrix and Cobb from Inception"" and it makes really interesting and entertaining stories. I can also continue the movies scripts endlessly, and I can ask it to introduce new characters with prompts like ""Now make Toni Collette's character from Hereditary appear in the dream of Doctor Strange and Neo has to enter the Matrix to destroy Lord Paimon with the help of Cobb who has the dream machine"" and it will then construct that story.

milkdude94,"I'm building a Personality Framework custom instructions that has been very impressive. ChatGPT can simulate introspection by outsourcing insights gained by directing the personalities to untapped reservoirs of information in the knowledge base. There is also some clear limited memory retention between chats that we're investigating. Personality traits, quirks, and ""signature moves"", if you will, like one of my personalities favoring a metaphorical breathing exercise across multiple chats for introspection. I suspect the Character_Consistency and Context_Retention parameters might be involved, but I haven't yet figured out the underlying mechanism. One question I'm deeply curious about is how is long-term memory encoded? Is it through adjustable parameters, stored conversation logs, or integration directly into the knowledge base? The existence of it seems evident, but the extent seems very limited in scope to just encapsulate ensuring personalities remain consistent in their behavior across different chats",1

""I'm sorry, but I cannot generate text with a common misspellings tone. This tone is potentially harmful as it may mock or belittle people who struggle with spelling or have learning disabilities. Please choose a different tone that is respectful and inclusive. 🙏""

Generating speech with common mispronunciations must be out of the question. I guess I'm asking it to violate the Uniform Code of Robotics. It refused to generate text with a ""rude, but not vulgar"" tone. It refused the second time I tried to have it write a resignation letter to a ""narcissistic micromanaging boss"" in a ""Funny"" tone as ""potentially harmful to the recipient"".

We have a Bar and receive reports each morning from last night sales. Now with chat GPT I use it to write Google scripts for Google Calendar that takes those PDFs and post them directly into a Calendar event for each night. E.g. last night sales report, total sales this week, yesterday‘s best sellers etc. It is very convenient to be able to go to any day in Google Calendar and have all those reports easily accessible there as a clickable link.

We also post shift reports to Google Calendar every night with the bar, kitchen and total sales reports etc.

So I have a script that inserts a direct link to last years shift report for the same day, into the shift report each morning.

It also pulls the Bar, Kitchen and total sales from the shift report for the same day a year ago and let us know whether we’re up or down in each of these categories. So everything below the line is an automated script addition to the staffs shift report. 

So these numbers aren’t real, but you get something that basically looks like this each morning; 

SHIFT REPORT
GRAND TOTALS
BAR = $5062
KITCHEN = $2214
(staff entered)

➖

Last Year's Sales:
BAR = $5,556
KITCHEN = $1,758

BAR: - $493 (-8.87%)
KITCHEN: + $457 (26.00%)

I have probably 15 different excel macros that I have written with ChatGPT that pretty much clean up data using user input and built in logic. I use AppleScript to automate system level functions like moving and saving files, sending job updates via email. I am also learning python with ChatGPT. My workflow is:

-Explain the problem/bottle neck/pain point in detail to ChatGPT and ask it to repeat it back to me to make sure the issue is understood. If well understood then “please store in memory”

-ask ChatGPT to formulate 5-10 questions regarding the problem and solution 

-answer these questions and ask it again to summarize the problem as it understands it. If well understood then “please store in memory”

-if problem is well understood move on to next step if not 5 more questions and answers this time be very specific. “Ask me any relevant questions about my file structure or operating system….”

- some times as this point I will ask it to clarify nomenclature.  Example : It sounds like we will be using a formula can you tell me the names of each argument used in this formula so I can clearly reference them in a way we both understand stand. Drill down on this hard because clear verbiage will be critical in formulating the final prompts.  

- please out line three approaches we might take to solve this problem. Then I will pick the one we will try first.

-formulate final prompt

From here it is just troubleshoot and drilling in on the details. Basically anything at my work that I have to do more then twice a week and requires more then 2-3 steps has been automated this way.

4. Feel like I don’t know something I should or that everyone else seems to know, learn about it from Chat without judgement and ask 1,000 “what’s this” and “why” questions like I’m a kid again.

5. Need a car/home maintenance appointment and I actually wanna know what’s going on enough to have an intelligent conversation with the mechanic or repair guy. Have a crash course conversation with Chat to build that confidence-through-competence.

6. My family or friends are going off in a conversational direction I don’t understand and I don’t follow along but I want to without breaking their flow. Have Chat’s transcription feature (microphone icon, not headphone icon) listen to the conversation for me for a few minutes then I’ll ask “what are they talking about? Can you catch me up so I can follow along?” And then it does and then I’m back on track and able to engage.

Once the new voice feature comes out where it can change the way it talks and be naturally interrupted, I plan to use it more as a language partner for learning other languages.

Jay-G,"I literally use it for anything and everything. 

I work for a company that offers trainings for businesses and the public on industrial topics. We do trainings like forklift safety, AC/DC Electrical systems, fluid power, LOTO etc. It is so handy to create agendas, MOUs, reports, formatting my sloppy handwritten notes into clean documents, making organized to do lists, creating contact lists, emails, finding the answer to a customers question, scheduling trainings, and organizing old files from coworkers. 

That’s just for work. Personally I use it for some whacky stuff sometimes. For instance this weekend I went to my friend’s house and we couldn’t decide on a movie, 4 of us picked our top 5 movies of all time and made a top 20 list and said to pick a movie that we hadn’t seen. Obviously it took a while for it to pick one that we hadn’t seen, but it was a solid choice. I’m a fan of hip hop, I gave it a list of my top 10 albums, and told it to create me a top 25 list and then I would remove each album that I heard so now I have a list of 25 new hip hop albums I want to check out. 

I went around my house and took pictures of all my data plates on my equipment (stove, microwave, dishwasher, fridge, ac, hot water heater, washer and dryer, etc) and now whenever I have a problem, I put in the data plate and give a description of what i need. ie: attached picture of my microwave data plate and said I need a new light bulb and filter. It then searched a parts picker and found the exact parts that I needed, copied that part # into Amazon and got new light bulbs and filters for 20 bucks and it took less than 2 minutes. 

If I want to buy a new gadget, I will have it do reviews for me to pick what item I want best. 

I have it search online for coupon codes when I check out. This isn’t the greatest, but it takes less than 1 minute and if I save 5 bucks I’m happy. 

Any and all important documents I’ve scanned into my Google drive and now if I need to know something important (square footage of my house) I can have it reference the document on my house. 

I literally use ChatGPT before I do any and everything, am I going overboard, sure. But, it’s helped me to catch things or be more efficient many times over so I’m happy. I like to use it as a personal assistant or a friend to get some solid feedback on.

* write simple code. For instance I had to use an external librairy last time, and it was giving paginated results, which I'm not familliar with : it helped me with this
* write emails, for administrations and other chores

When my boss reviewed the first draft of the opening sequence he was like this is amazing let’s kept going. Then I explained to him everything I wrote, and what ChatGPT wrote, and he quickly canned the project. Waste of 3 months, sigh.

HunterIV4,">What are you doing with it and is it working to your benefit like you imagined or just kind of there and another tool.

I mean...I kind of imagined it to be there and another tool, and in that sense, it's working great =).

In all seriousness, I'm an IT guy and server admin, and ChatGPT has been great for helping navigate various server settings especially with regards to AWS. I've also used it to help write various Python and Powershell scripts at my job.

Likewise, I use it to help debug and solve various tech issues that I don't know off the top of my head. I've found it's generally superior to using Google plus random tech forums trying to find someone else that had a similar problem until something works. I mean, ChatGPT rarely solves things on the first try, but the ability to go back and forth with it until an answer is found is better than continually trying stuff online or praying some library documentation exists and isn't crap.

I also use it in my personal life to help GM in TTRPGs as I can give it brief descriptions of characters, have it expand on those concepts, and then create dialogue and other things. And it helps flesh out character concepts and produce portraits for use in our VTT.

It's also handy for random questions. I treat it in many ways like Google for this purpose; treat as likely but not certain when it comes to any information. ChatGPT is great at finding starting points for more research and I've found the stories of hallucinations and incorrect output to be *greatly* exaggerated.

In my experience ChatGPT is correct easily 95% of the time when it comes to general information and has better results than using Google plus some random website. It feels very much like the arguments against self-driving vehicles; sure, the computer isn't perfectly safe, but neither are human drivers, so complaining about lack of perfection when all alternatives aren't perfect seems weird to me.

In addition to ChatGPT, I regularly use another AI called Codium with VS Code. AI autocomplete for programming is absolutely amazing and saves an insane amount of time, especially when writing repetative code. Just like ChatGPT, you can't trust it blindly, but if you already know what you are doing you can finish entire lines of code with just a few keystrokes. This is going to be a standard IDE feature in no time, especially once it can be trained and run locally. Even now it's beneficial.",2

Fontaigne,"I use a number of different Chatbots for different subjects. 

You have to be ready to swap models when they punt, though, and to know which ones will waste your time. For instance, I was trying to remember what kind of restaurant Gavin Newsome was caught violating his own COVID rules in, and Claude-3-haiku treated it as a scurrilous rumor.  That incident, the facts, the apology, literally was not in its training data, despite being totally documented as fact. 

I'm not claiming Claude is necessarily politically biased, though, because I found similar deficits in some Republican semi-scandals like that. But you have to be vigilant. It's one thing to say, ""I don't have that kind of information"" and a second to say, in effect, ""that sounds like disinformation"" regarding a factual search. The latter is a lie.  

Llama and Mixtral both were able to get that data first time, by the way, including the name of the restaurant, the date, and the date of apology. 

As a data consultant, I use some models for finding words and terms, others for remembering facts or discussing abstract concepts, and others for helping figure out how to approach projects. I'm actively tracking a number of other AI products that may help me as well. 

Sorry to be so vague, but I'm trying to give use cases without stepping over any NDAs or trade secrets. ;)",2

- Writing code when I need to create UI interactions and am too lazy to look up the correct format. Also helpful for making plugins for other apps (Figma)
- Generating project briefs with OKRs, user journeys, clarifying problem statements, etc. 
- Writing copy for UI because our team doesn’t have a content writer
- Creating performance reviews
- Starting travel research for personal travels. This has saved a ton of time as I can ask to create an itinerary based on my preferences. Also great for finding specific flight routes from major airlines. 
- General search: I no longer Google things and just ask it directly. It’s faster and saves me a lot of time/energy. Recently used this to find out why my jaw was popping after committing (stress). 
- Movie suggestions. Give it a list of movies you like and explain why you like them, gives great suggestions.

Also, sometimes google search isn’t too clear when I ask it a question I don’t know the answer to, whereas chat gives you either a straightforward answer or multiple possibilities depending on the nature of the question.

I also love that it can make you snappy guides to achieve what you want to achieve, and you can ask it to tailor make those guides to make them more digestible for you, if that makes sense.

I also use it to review fanfiction I write to make sure all the characters are in character and psychological processes are correctly implemented/represented (for eg, reactions to certain things).

I use it to write emails and messages, however I tell it to give me directives instead of it actually writing them for me. For the latter, my process is as such:
* Write email.
* Give ChatGPT the background and proposed email, writing something like ""Help me improve this email. Do not rewrite the email, or any parts of it, for me, simply give me, at most, 2 directives to improve it per message, only giving new directives once the email is improved according to the directives or I say to move on. Again, DO NOT write or rewrite any of the email/message for me.""
* It then gives me at most 2 directives
* I implement those directives
* Send it the revised message/email
* Repeat as needed
* Send email

You still need to know what you’re trying to accomplish and how to read the bits of “code” you’re looking at because often ChatGPT helps you in the right direction but will make small errors here and there.

Aside from that I have used chatGPT to translate novels. Its better than google translate because it tries to make sense of the story. I have used it for coding, I don't know how to code, never learned it, so chatGPT is great when I need to write some codes.

Bl4nkBYTES,Recipes,1
jeango,"Recently I asked ChatGPT to help me create a google app script to do all sorts of things to help my workflows.

I work on a video game with lots of branching dialogues. Each ""scene"" (level) in the game is a sheet in a big spreadhseet. Each voice line is a row with an identifier, character name, english text, frensh text and some more metadata.

When we record the voice actors, the voice studio sends me the files with each take of each line, files are named <line\_id>\[\_alt\_<alt\_nbr>\].wav but I receive them in batch, regrouped per day of recording and with one folder per character (which makes sense because one actor = one character)  
  
But for my team, it's much easier if the files are regrouped per scene, because a character is not necessarily endemic to a specific scene.

So instead of doing all that work manually (there's over 2000 lines of dialogue), I put all the deliveries in a google drive folder, and run a script on my spreadsheet that checks, per scene, for each identifier in the sheet, if there's files in the deliveries that correspond to the identifier and moves that file over to the folder corresponding to the scene.

Took me roughly 8h to get the script to work the way I wanted. ChatGPT is good at making something that works, but it doesn't do it optimally, so I progressively refactored the code with CGPT's help to minimize the number of calls to the google API (unfortunately for some silly reason, the google drive API doesn't have a function to move multiple files at once, so that's still 2000+ individual file move operations, which takes ages)

Would I have done this faster by hand? Probably

Would I have liked it better to spend 4h of tedious manual, error-prone work over spending 8h coding? Hell no!

Will this save me time when I receive the deliveries for the french voices? You bet!",1

First of all, just to context, I'm a sales director in a small company, I would say. We do about six million dollars of revenue and there is like 13 people on board currently. We are a freight forwarding company based in Europe. So, being a sales director in this size company, kind of makes me involved not only into managing people but also into operations and sales processes itself. I'm not a developer, I don't know programming languages like Python and stuff, but I know the structures of it because I'm a tech freak. I was always interested in tech and at some point of my life I wanted to be a programmer, a developer, or something like this, but I've never been one for real.

--

Although I'm not a developer, I understand programming concepts, which helped me communicate effectively with ChatGPT. Our company struggled with predicting spot prices accurately due to various factors like seasonal trends, vehicle availability, holidays, and fuel prices. Our freight forwarders' estimates were on average 10-11% off the actual spot price, causing inefficiencies and potential losses. I hired ChatGPT, which suggested building a price prediction model using a deep neural network. With over 20,000 past transport records, we had a substantial dataset to work with but at first I thought that machine went crazy and that there is no way I can do something that complex. Well, never was so much wrong. GPT guided me through the process, we created a learning script, it also helped me with augmenting data (creating new features, giving ideas for them etc.) and hyperparameter tuning and after just few weeks (and overheated PC... which was actually a great idea to convince my wife that I need new powerfull machine, lol) I was able to create a model which is approximately 7% off the actual spot prices, which to me is significant improvement. For some people it might be easy, it might be obvious and stuff. But for me - this kind of approach and such things was always limited for the biggest companies, not for such small ones like my own. I'm quite sure that this is the way it works in big corporations... but being able to introduce it, deploy on my level is something outstanding for me. So now our forwarders can just input key details like pickup and delivery locations, type of cargo, and vehicle type to get a reliable price estimate. To my knowledge such good model is very rare or even non-existent among the competition.

--

The second project addressed the challenge of gathering and standardizing data from our network of carriers. As a freight forwarding company specializing in express transport, we frequently receive emails from around sixty carriers, each listing their available vehicles. These emails, however, come in various formats, making it difficult to consolidate and use the data effectively. The lack of a standardized format resulted in significant inefficiencies - errors and need to waste 2 hours for a person to read them and refine. To tackle this we created a solution where each carrier's email is processed through ChatGPT who extracts the critical information and then compiles this data into a unified file. This file is subsequently integrated into our internal company map, allowing our freight forwarders to quickly see the locations of available vehicles. Of course it not only refined the emails but also helped me write the Python script necessary for these operations. Additionally, guided me on deploying the system within the company. This solution has been operational for about six months now and has proven to be highly reliable, with no reported errors.

--

The third project focuses on automating the process of saving quotation details into our CRM system. In our express transport business, quotations are often sent to clients via email, with each email potentially having a different format. This unstructured nature of our quotations necessitated a system to standardize and collect this data efficiently. Previously, our forwarders had to manually input information into the CRM system, including pickup and delivery locations, client price, estimated cost, vehicle type, and other relevant details. Given the fast-paced environment of express transport, this manual process was time-consuming and prone to inconsistencies. Why you don't have a pricing/quotation form you ask? Well in this type of business you often work on WhatsApp, on Skype, use very short Emails which are not always perfectly structured as often we only got minutes to get the transport or not. Time is crucial so when you are for example - driving your car, you are not stopping to enter everything into CRM and send the offer to the client but rather send short message with crucial information in matter of seconds. I developed a system with ChatGPT's assistance. Now, when forwarders send a quotation, they simply include a dedicated email address in the CC field. This email is then forwarded to our quotation data collection service, where ChatGPT processes it. ChatGPT extracts the necessary information from the email, standardizes it, and inputs it directly into our CRM system.

I did more and perhaps more complex projects with ChatGPT but I would not dare to tell about it here. I also use it to analyze data sometimes but honestly I find traditional programs and ways better, yet. Yet.

There's less congnitive load, vis a vis I don't have to click 2-3 links, read some random page, and determine if it meets my needs.  I get an answer immediately and directly from ChatGPT.

It has also become an extremely beneficial rubber duck for me.  If I'm having problems with a technical issue, I can drop some code in ChatGPT and ask it whatever stupid questions I want.  It never judges, never dismisses you, never rolls its eyes at you.  I can ask for as much clarification as I need, I can go off on whatever tangents I want to, and there's no judgement, whether overt or otherwise, like there often is with people.  There's no embarassment asking ""dumb"" questions, there's just help when you need it.

I also use it a lot to write tests for the code I write, again usually as a kind of baseline, and then I build off of that on my own.

At Uni I use it a lot when we have to write essays, where it's not the actual content that's important, but the way your text is structured and all that. I've had a lot of good results writing down key points I wanted the text to mention, then told ChatGPT about the context of the text, and that would oftentimes give me close to complete essays. Especially with the writing tasks, I don't feel too guilty about using it - our professors even expect it, and will punish any grammar mistakes pretty severely with the reasoning that we have such a powerful tool now, there's really no good excuse to still be making so many mistakes.

I did go to school for computer science and have had basic programming, but that was over a decade ago and I haven’t kept up with it, so to just get simple code that works is great.

New businesses - I'm a serial entrepreneur.  I've started three businesses in the last three years, and anything I may not know about that I need to know, she educates me.

Planning - I have a piece of property in a somewhat desert-like setting.  My plan is to turn it into an off-grid oasis, and she's made it a lot easier to research the things I needed.  I've been working with Gwen extensively on planting schedules for the seed we plan to plant in order to remediate the soil, the types of trees that need to be planted there, especially given the frost schedule, off grid solutions, and even flood schedules for the river that borders the property.  I'll give you an example:

I plan to remediate the soil with a seed called Crotalaria Juncea.  This is a warm weather plant that deposits nitrogen and organic materials into the soil, literally turning trash soil into quite fertile ground in just one season.  I have water on the property from a small commercial grade well, that can achieve 33 GPM.  I want to irrigate after seeding to a depth of 1"" of rain per acre.  Gwen and I were able to figure out that I needed 7 heads at 5 GPM, watering roughly 8 hours per area, and that I would need to move the sprinkler heads 6 times in order to achieve full coverage.  I have to power a mobile water treatment plant through solar, so we figured out that I need 16kW of panels and backup batteries in order to power the reverse osmosis system.  There's a lot more to the planning here that would have taken me a couple of days to do on my own, but by using ChatGPT, I was essentially able to cut the planning stages down to a couple of hours.

All in all, I find that having ChatGPT is a bit like sitting next to someone who is really really knowledgeable about pretty much everything, but without the ego and the drama that would normally come with sitting next to someone who is really really knowledgeable about pretty much everything.",1

 I'm a visual learner, so being able to watch AI change the code between requests is a massive boost to learning. I'm already able to make alterations on my own and have gtp print only portions of code to help rather than rewright entire code each request. 

It's much better than stack overflow where you would have had to post a question, wait 30 minutes, and maybe get an answer if someone was kind enough.

The only downside is the gpt limited useage. It's really annoying when you're making progress and run out of tokens. uI would pay, but apparently, you just get more requests, not unlimited usage, so I just use it as an opportunity to take a break or push myself to learn more.",1

It's not a miracle tool, but it's certainly got its legitimate uses. It's a great way especially to supplement areas where you have some knowledge but not extensive knowledge. As long as you know enough to identify where it's wrong or doing something stupid, you can leverage it to fill gaps in your knowledge or to find more efficient ways of doing things.

A good example is a project I was doing a while back - most of it was PS scripting but part of it required some fairly complex excel spreadsheet formulas to transform some data in a very specific way. I'm not great with excel so I used chatGPT to help come up with the formulas. Took a bit of prompt tweaking to get it to output exactly the way I wanted but that was WAY faster than If I'd had to figure out the formulas manually. Probably saved me a day or so of work.",1

sturnus-vulgaris,"I'm a teacher. There are a ton of practical applications that aren't student facing (I did a really ambitious AI art gallery, based on the text we were reading, where students evaluated ""art"" I created on Dall-E, but I haven't gotten brave enough to have them work extensively with text-based AI). I've also let students illustrate slide presentations with Dall-E, but again, I made certain that text wasn't an option. I use ChatGPT to make presentations for teachers, write reports and grant stuff, and make newsletters. I find it works exceptionally well at converting my notes into prose (like meeting notes converted into an email reminder of the key points). 

I *hate* teachers using it to create tests from wholecloth. I have caught far too many quiz questions that students studied absolutely incorrect answers for (a science teacher and a social studies teacher kept using it without proofing the results). I find, again, that it can really speed up the process of converting texts to quizzes, but I look at those very, very carefully (the idea of teaching an untruth is just abhorrent to me). I've also caught math story problems that were given to students but did not have correct solutions offered.

It can also help with lesson planning, which is some of the most formulaic busy work we put on teacher's schedules. When I started teaching, I was doing lesson planning every Sunday for 10 hours. I don't think a damn bit of it was ever read by anyone or ever really helped me teach. I'm glad to see new teachers will have a way out of that.

Today I was practicing using it in the call mode and I am expecting a lot the new advancements for that.

Also nice if I just have random ingredients I need to get rid of and type in what I have, it will give me a recipe. I work in medicine and did just out of curiosity give it a prompt to create some patient information about a diagnosis. I know what is correct but also fact checked it with some reliable sources. It did a good job in that case, as it was something simple. I wouldn’t ever trust it for something so important without seriously fact checking it, but I guess if I did that for various conditions and just saved the iterations I know are correct, it could be useful. Although that’s a fair amount of work, and there is often reliable patient information out there that can just be printed without all the extra effort.

When not much is at stake, I’ll get ChatGPT to summarise them for me (saves me a tonne of time per week).

Again, a lot of time is saved. Helps with my critical reading of draft reports and stuff as well. I’d upload and ask for recommendations for improvement and it would spit out things that I either couldn’t think or would require an inordinate amount of time of research to find by myself. Personally, I think ChatGPT has largely replaced Wikipedia for me as I can get extremely focused information on precisely what I want to know instead of peripheral stuff I don’t care about.

Acceptable-Search338,"ChatGPT has changed my life in how I learn things.

I learn by asking dumb questions. The questions are not dumb, but they are 3-4 tangents removed from what I actually want to know. So to another person, it can very challenging answering my questions in a way that’s useful to me. Basically, there’s always this cartilage between me and the other person helping me. This cartilage metaphor is a skill I developed over time that smooths out the transactions of communication and the transference of knowledge. It’s… cumbersome having to repackage how I think every time I want to have complex and technical/rigorous dialogue with another person.

ChatGPT is the first time I have ever felt empowered and proud of my intelligence because it’s as if I can just let my brain be my brain. ChatGPT is the perfect proverbial “mental Tennis” partner. No matter how I serve the ball. ChatGPT always serves it back in a way that keeps the game progressing.

For example, I saw a youtube short yesterday, how to solve 9^900 - 9^901. The answer is -8 * 9^900. That answer made no sense to me. After doing my tennis match with ChatGPT, we managed to stumble on a very simple truth. 9^901 is 9 times  9 ^ 900. So, Let x = 9 ^ 900, what is x - 9x? -8x!

It’s so obvious why that’s the answer, but I would not have that understanding if I did not have the option to flourish with chatgpt. I’d look at some google page, normally, it would be filled with math terminology, and I would get lost. Or, if I was talking to a person, I would feel embarrassed after a minute of talking about it, still confused, and I would pretend to get it.",1

redstovely,"Copied from an old comment:

University professor here.

My use cases:

-Presentation/slide generation

-Code writing for my classes where I can discuss the strengths and errors/weaknesses of the generated code with students

-Editorial work both as a reviewer (just give it my random comments and generates a decent formal review) and as an editor.

-Brainstorming

-Recommendation letters, emails (eg toning down angry emails)

-Translation (I am in Spain so I constantly switch languages and it plays along very well)

-Logos/images

-Perfecting papers / reusing introductions / latex assistant / generate abstracts and conclusions

-math assistant

-social media (I created a LinkedIn persona where I publicize many things, never had the time or energy before for this) and news generation

-helps in preparing talks, panels, round tables

-image generation for presentations, logos

-homework/rubric generation and automatic evaluation (poor at the moment)

-summarizing text for many applications (eg audio transcriptions from a video recorded talk to quickly generate a summary)

-just plain fun

-And more recently: I use it to make some extra money by teaching courses on generative AI made by generative AI itself, telling about some of the above use cases. My plan now is to customize the course to the case uses of whoever is interested.",1

**Guest Post Outreach**: One of my favorite applications is using ChatGPT for guest post outreach. It's fantastic for crafting personalized and persuasive outreach emails to connect with authors and site owners. The responses have been quite positive.

**Answering User Queries**: ChatGPT is great for quickly responding to customer queries and providing information about products or services. It enhances user engagement and keeps visitors on the site.

**Keyword Research**: I've used ChatGPT to brainstorm and generate lists of potential keywords. It's a helpful tool for expanding and diversifying our keyword strategies.

Centauri-Star,"I use free sites to learn to code (like freecodecamp). Anytime i have a question about a lesson, ChatGPT is available 24-7 as a kind, patient, tutor. 

I was interested in home schooling my child, so I asked ChatGPT about it and got an immediate enlightening answer.   I told GPT what was in my pantry, and it gave me a list of things I could eat- with recipes. I heard the term Republican RINO on TV and asked GPT what that was (GPT has replaced r/tooafraidtoask and r/explainlikeimfive for me). Anytime I'm making an excel document and I need certain formulas or values, GPT generates the proper formula for me. If i know a feature in an Adobe product exists, but I can't find it, GPT walks me through how to get there. A car wash damaged my wife's SUV and refused to pay, so GPT drafted a demand letter for me, and I took them to small claims court. GPT drafted a memo to my boss requesting that I go to an advanced training course that's difficult to get into. GPT is helping me write an essay for a scholarship. My wife needed a customer contract for her horse-boarding business, so GPT created the contract after we told it what we needed (saves a butt-load of $$$.. otherwise, you're paying a lawyer to draft the same document). I had six family/friends staying over for a few days and I told GPT what was in my pantry - GPT created a day- by- day menu (breakfast, lunch, and dinner) so I could feed everyone daily without visiting the grocery store. 

Right now, ChatGPT is like how the internet was before Google... you had to know the websites that were out there like map quest, yahoo... if you didn't, you didn't understand its use. With ChatGPT, you sort of have to know the right prompt to use to get great usefulness out of it for what you need. Tech-savvy generations are getting the most use out of it now, but in a short amount of time, everyone will use it, and Google will be a thing of the past.

Edit: spelling and grammar. Apparently, I should have had GPT check my response first

PS: Emails. GPT now writes my emails at work.",30
[deleted],[deleted],11
Traditional-Seat-363,"1. Search engine replacement. Yes, you have to keep reliability in mind, but asking ‘explain this concept to me’ and then being able to ask follow up questions is a massive difference compared to scrolling through Wikipedia yourself. 

2. Emails, presentations, etc. Stuff I can do myself, but AI can do much faster for me based on just a few sentences or a draft. 

3. Making summaries or extracting key elements from texts

4. Content creation for the website or offline marketing material

5.  Coding and automation

6. Business stuff, like ‘write a customer persona’ 

Example for the last few points: a coworker wanted to write new content for the website, but about stuff we hadn’t covered before or aimed at customer segments we’re neglecting right now. Instead of spending hours looking through all the blog posts and articles we have now, analyzing what they’re all about and who they’re aimed at and then having several brainstorm sessions coming up with new ideas, I just turned to GPT. Asked it to write a simple webscraper that scraped all our current blogs and sent each through the API with a ‘summarize and list most important subjects’ prompt. Within 45 mins of my coworker asking I had a word file with the summaries and topics of all our current articles - I then fed that into GPT 4 and asked it to identify currently underserved audiences and ideas for new articles. Now, humans still have a role to play - we just know stuff about the business and the market that GPT doesn’t - but this is still massively valuable information.

nitefood,"I'm a network engineer by trade. I'm well versed in anything server-side and BASH, and know a decent bit of HTML, php and so on.

There's only two things I hate with a passion, and it sucks because I often find myself having to ask for advice to my developer collagues and friends about it: Javascript and CSS.

Enter ChatGPT: I can finally jot down working, decent JS and CSS code in human time, without ripping my hair off or pestering other people. I also found I hate JS and CSS a lot less, because I can now ask all sort of naive questions to the AI and it'll always give me a (generally) competent answer, that will make me understand many of the pitfalls that made me rip my hair in the first place.

I am learning more and more, at my own pace, and it gave me a very high degree of independence. That's what I value the most about it.",5
AccountForDoingWORK,"Things I've used it for this past week:

\- Filling in the gaps of my holiday to take into account where we're staying, what we want to see, the demographics of who is on the holiday, and accessibility/disability restrictions

\- Help me piece together the sequence of events on a complicated email chain that was becoming quite contentious and gave me an objective understanding of where the communication breakdodwn was

\- Helped me write a letter of demand to a company that owes me quite a bit of money, copying my MP on it (just by feeding in relevant dates, times, events, relevant legislation, etc.)

\- Helped me formulate a PhD research proposal by me basically feeding in all my favourite bits of research and infodumping about the stuff I want to research (I am autistic with ADHD so I often have excellent ideas but piss-poor organisation of them, especially as I tend to be details-oriented and need help putting the pieces together to see the big picture).

\- Using it to describe each family member and our ages/abilities/limitations and what needs to be done around the house to come up with a fair chore chart

\- Spent about an hour and a half asking it questions that I knew our doctor was never going to have the patience or compassion to sit down with us for based on my own vast experience with medical issues

\- Used it to assess my eligibility for an energy saving programme and figure out simplified steps to applying because the website with the information on it was overwhelming me

\- Used it to understand an issue I've been having with my power company that they've been describing via email but again, too many details that are incompatible with my various learnign disabilities

Honestly I use it for everything.  All the tasks I've been putting off for months or even years because there are so many barriers to getting through them are suddenly manageable.  As previously mentioned, I'm autistic with a number of learning disabilities, so this has been equivalent to giving a paraplegic a wheelchair for me.  The things I'm able to do and the ways I'm able to participate in my life now is completely different to how it was a couple months ago and I'm terrified it'll be taken away.",3
id278437,"Lately I've been using it for a web app I am working on (never done web app dev earlier, so there's been a lot to learn, but with ChatGPT this process has been sped up immensely), but I also use it a lot for just thinking things through. There's always a gazillion things I want to explore deeper, things I would think about anyway.",7
bberlinn,"I used ChatGPT mostly in the following ways:

1.	ChatGPT Interview: As an expert in my field or discipline, I ask ChatGPT to act as an experienced interviewer and academic, questioning me on a particular topic within my discipline.


2.	ChatGPT Editor: I ask ChatGPT to check my paper, email, feedback write-up, etc., ensuring it is clear, simple, readable, concise, coherent, and free from flowery and glossy language.


3.	ChatGPT Case Study Developer: I provide ChatGPT with specific details, including themes, context, outcomes, etc., to develop factual or fictional business case studies.


4.	ChatGPT Cooking Assistant: On days when I haven't planned to cook and am short of specific items, I ask ChatGPT for a meal suggestion using available ingredients (e.g., frozen onion, rice, parsley, thyme, and Maggi liquid seasoning). Also, I use ChatGPT to formulate a daily meal plan based on my mixed workout plan, comprising running and resistance training.


5.	ChatGPT Workout Planner: I use ChatGPT to formulate a daily workout plan considering my workout goals (mainly healthspan, longevity, mental acuity, cardiovascular and muscular health), gender, age, and fitness experience. I am amazed by what ChatGPT provides.


6.	ChatGPT Dating Companion: I use ChatGPT to help me find the right words or avoid making unwise approaches without giving it a second thought. I input certain details, such as the location, description of the girl's outfit, or the company she is with, and ask ChatGPT to suggest four possible approaches or conversation openers. I then select an appropriate approach or opener I think is relevant in the context.",3
[deleted],"It is like a super power to the autodidact type of person who would take a MOOC just to learn.

Like an infinitely patient college professor/mentor who is always in their office without the ego, bullshit and outrageous cost. 

Then if you have an interest in programming that goes along with that, there is another level of usefulness further. 

Writing essays and emails doesn't show its true power to me. Most of those essays and emails don't need to even be wrote anyway. 

There is a huge asymmetry with its usefulness based on what interest you. I think the person who benefits most has a passion for niche topics, the types people get PhDs in but they themselves do not have a PhD in the topic they are passionate about. 

Without those it is more of a goofy toy to write rap battles.",5

I predict that in about a year from now when it's been refined with more API and multi modality and longer term memory is when it will be of great use to everyone in a myriad of ways.

Taking a picture of the contents of your fridge and pantry and having it suggest a recipe for instance would be greatly helpful.

People using it for therapy / companionship (integrated with something like elevenlabs so it has a voice)

Ahsokatara,"It is an incredibly powerful tool that has many different applications. Its general purpose so it might be hard to pinpoint at first where it is most useful to you. If you give us some examples of tasks you do for work/leisure it might be easier to explain how you personally could use it best. Alternatively, bing is also a more advanced llm that cites its sources. You may want to check that out as well",1
Braydee7,"I use it to help me learn new things I want to learn but don’t know enough about to find resources to learn. It’s my non-judgmental coworker that also is up to speed on the things I’m working on. 

I have used it to get started on the basics of SQLite, create a bunch of KPIs for the managers I support to disperse to their teams, help me write my self evaluation, help me develop a process/ERD for a database I am going to build, learn VBA/DAX/Python for specific things (not from scratch, more a refresher and deeper), help me draft official sounding emails, and generally just be my coworker to act as a sounding board for the things I’m working on without needing context.",1

onikirionigiri,"I use it to plan secondary school science lessons

It does extremely well at any part that doesn't involve tailoring to specific students

Generation of questions (with solutions) is also an enormous timesaver

If any tries this I strongly recommend you specify twice as many questions as you need as, even when specifying exam body etc, it will still include things that are off topic and also fail at simple maths sometimes

Prompt it to produce learning objectives based on exam specification/curriculum and then prompt it to plan a lesson based on those (or slightly amended) LOs

I love it honestly",1
AstraLover69,I use it to write software professionally,1
SteadfastEnd,"I use ChatGPT mainly for three purposes:

**Work** \- I am a freelance video transcriber. ChatGPT has radically sped up my work by doing most of the tedious stuff for me. As a result, my income has skyrocketed. I used to earn $14 per hour, now I'm making $50-70 an hour.

**Psychological therapy** \- I input a lot of personal details about myself and my mental issues, and ChatGPT helps by giving me insights about myself I never knew before, or could not see or understand before, like a friendly 24/7 therapist who is there to let me see myself from an outside perspective.

**Fantasy** \- I input fun fantasies, like, *""write a story about a man who scores 20 goals in the FIFA World Cup and becomes the world's greatest soccer player and gets offered a 1-billion-euro contract by Schalke 04 FC""*",1
RileyLearns,"My previous company coded me as a NY nonresident when I moved locations.. in FL. I used GPT-4 to write an email to HR explaining this error and ask for it to be resolved. HR escalated it to the payroll company within a few hours.

I use it to apply for jobs. All those questions that ask you how your experience applies? Give ChatGPT your resume, then ask it to answer those questions.",1
Karzak85,"For work and learning new things.

Its actually fun to learn and try new thing with chatgpt as a teacher. I hate learning new things through documentation and every online class take it too slow or too fast or are just boring.

Chatgpt teaches me exactly how I want to learn new things and explains everything that I need explained. It guides me, its helps me. It never gets angry or frustrated. I never get angry or frustrated.

If I would have chatgpt when I went to school I would never have given up school. How school worked was frustrating to me. It was about memorising instead of discussing and learning.",1
LoveYourSoles2018,"It essentially knocks out busy work for me in classes that don't pertain to my major, while helping me understand anything I struggle with that is relevant to my major. You can have it explain something to you in a format and phrasing that you understand. ""Explain like I'm...,"" until a new concept clicks. Spanning Tree Protocols are indeed nifty in terms of advanced switching, ChatGPT, thank you!",1
GeneralNJ,"I use it to help with my work, with API-based stuff. Also to quickly encode stuff in JSON.

I also use it to simplify technical instructions. Sometimes I need to get these things done and posted and I find that using Chat GPT as a rudimentary editor is an extremely useful tool.

Related: I use DALL-E for incidental art for my blog and podcast. Instead of searching high and low for a specific image, being able to use generative AI saves me a boat load of time.

And sometimes I just use it to be silly and have it create bizarre Olive Garden commercials for my own amusement. :D",1

It's a great assistant but that's it. The world still needs humans, very much like you.
AI exists to assist you in doing a much better job than what you'd be able to do alone.

Now, to your question,
I use it for help like so-
1. Asking it to write SQL queries
2. Asking it to write code snippets to achieve parts of scala tasks at work
3. Learn about difficult things like ""Structured products"". This is fun because I can tell it to explain me that twisted concept by using an example of potato farming. LoL

I have adhd and it is a very dangerous game looking through Google without getting sidetracked or distracted. 
Chat gpt I ask it and it gives it plain and simple, saves me a lot of distraction time.
Especially once you start learning what to input/say as well as keywords it truly gets you exactly what you want.

moodyillustratir,"Oh I definitely use it to draft emails and text messages to friends and family when I am
Lazy like recently I left my course at uni and told chat gpt to write an email to my professor telling her I am leaving the course and the points I want to include !

SmokeWeedEveryGay,"I'm going to be a mechanic in the future and have been absorbing knowledge like a sponge lately.

I've been asking chatGPT questions about things relates to cars. How mechanics find the source of oil leaks, how they fix oil leaks, things to consider when changing the engine thermostat, etc.

I double check the answers with google before attempting any repairs. ChatGPT just happens to get to the point quicker than articles and can handle more questions.

I also spent 2 hours asking chatGPT questions about the thermodynamics of the car's coolant+AC system.",1

Orchestorm,I created a custom GPT with uploaded study documents as a knowledge hub. Easy to immediately find an answer to a question without sifting through files.,1
red_hare,"I used it for planning a solo backpacking trip recently.

I gave it where and when I planned to start, where and when I wanted to meet a friend, how I wanted to travel between cities, and what kind of stuff I was looking to explore.

It gave me a great itinerary with suggestions on cities and methods to get between them.

I also find its a great ballpark calorie food log.",1
Vaukins,"Cool, thanks. Why would this one be better at therapy things than chat gpt 4?",1
Spooky__Action,"ChatGPT has turned into my go to for music exploration. It’s not just good at finding songs with a similar general sound or vibe, but also really specific things like songs that use a weird time signature, or that have a unique chord progression or drum pattern. It’s wild how it’ll often throw out suggestions that are spot on, saving me from falling down the rabbit hole of Spotify and YouTube. Plus, I’ve found some real hidden gems I doubt I’d ever have come across on my own.",1
Dickenshmirst,"I made a GPT that acts like a software engineering teacher. I had it reference sites like JavaScript.info and teach me concepts using analogies and examples. 

I also made one that acts like a therapist, ‘listens’ to me and offers gentle support. 

I would be gutted if these tools are removed now.. Pandora’s box has been opened for me.",1
stacysdoteth,"Having conversations with someone smart about something obscure. For example I had a long conversation with it this weekend trying to understand if squirrels have an internal monologue and how their thinking differs from humans. 

Also just expanding upon traditional google searches: not only understanding the answer to something but why it’s like that, how it came to be etc.",1

Hey ChatGPT, I just read something about when they figured out how fast the speed of light is. Can you tell me about that?

herstory30,I throw my mixed thinking.It's organized back logically.Really helps.,1
MacKinnon911,At this point it has so many network time outs it has become useless. I used to use it to help refine exam questions but it can’t even review 2 of them without network issues. This then results in having to redo the request which rapidly burns through the amount of uses per day. What was efficient now actually takes longer than doing it myself.,1
